Term Definition A AST (Abstract syntax tree) Abstract Syntax Trees or ASTs are tree representations of code. They are a fundamental part of the way a compiler works. C Cluster A distributed MatrixOne deployment, which acts as a single logical application. E Explicit Transactions Explicit Transaction has the beginning, ending and rollback of transactions with the command Begin Transaction, Commit Transaction and Rollback Transaction. I Implicit Transactions Implicit Transaction is the auto commit. There is no beginning or ending of the transaction. O Optimistic transaction Optimistic transaction, the optimistic transaction means that when the transaction starts, no conflict detection or lock will be performed, the current relevant data will be cached in the corresponding memory area, and the data will be added, deleted, or modified. P Pessimistic transaction Pessimistic transaction, the default transaction mode of MatrixOne, that is, when the transaction starts, it will assume that the transaction-related tables are in a state where write conflicts will occur and lock the corresponding data table or a data row in advance to complete the locking action Finally, the insertion, modification, or deletion of data is cached in memory. After committing or rolling back, the data is placed on the disk, and the lock is released. S Snapshot Isolation (SI) Snapshot Isolation is a multi-version concurrency control approach that is widely used in practice. MatrixOne supports distributed transaction of snapshot isolation level. Concepts MatrixOne relies heavily on the following concepts. Being familiar with them will help you understand what our architecture achieves. Term Definition A Auto-Rebalance A modern distributed database should do more than just split data amongst a number of servers. The automatic process of storage and workload distribution among servers is called an Auto-Rebalance. C Consistency MatrixOne supports a strong consistency. It is guaranted that after any successful data write, the reading afterwards will get the latest value, no matter from which store. E Execution Plan An execution plan in a database is a simple graphical representation of the operations that the query optimizer generates to calculate the most efficient way to return a set of results. F Fault-Tolerance Fault-Tolerance simply means a system's ability to continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of one or more of its components. M Monolithic Engine A monolithic database engine is designed to support hybrid workloads: transactional, analytical, streaming, time-series, machine learning, and so on. Materialized View A materialized view is a pre-computed data set derived from a query specification (the SELECT in the view definition) and stored for later use. Materialized view is usually used for increasing performance and efficiency. Metadata Metadata is the data that describes the structure and creation method of data in a database. P Paxos Paxos is an algorithm that is used to achieve consensus among a distributed set of computers that communicate via an asynchronous network. R Raft Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. Raft Group and Leader Raft defines a strong, single leader and number of followers in a group of peers. The group represents a replicated state machine. Only the leader may service client requests. The leader replicates actions to the followers. S SIMD instruction SIMD is short for Single Instruction/Multiple Data, while the term SIMD operations refers to a computing method that enables processing of multiple data with a single instruction. T Transaction A set of operations performed on your database that satisfy the requirements of ACID semantics. TAE Transactional Analytic Engine. The storage engine is the main public interface of the storage layer, which can support both row and column storage and transaction processing capabilities. V Vectorized Execution Vectorized data processing helps with developing faster analytical query engines by making efficient utilization of CPU cache. Arrow's columnar format allows to use lightweight schemes like dictionary encoding, bit packing, and run length encoding, which favor query performance over compression ratio.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#glossary","text":"","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#terms","text":"It's helpful to understand a few terms before reading our architecture documentation.

This Git command downloads the content of MatrixOne repository you forked on GitHub to your local device. Step 3: Add MatrixOne repo as a remote repository You can add MatrixOrigin/MatrixOne repository as a remote repository in local with: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git upstream is the designation of this remote repository. If you want to replace it with other words you want, don't forget to replace it as well in the next steps, or some errors will happen. Step 4: Develop Make some changes Now you can edit the code, modify the documents, and make whatever changes you want about your issue in the branch you just created. Run MatrixOne in a standalone mode If you want to demonstrate whether the changes you made are valid or produce an issue, you need to run MatrixOne in a standalone mode. Before running, make sure you have deployed MatrixOne according to our Deploy standalone MatrixOne . Step 5: Commit to your local repo Having completed your modification, you can add the files you just modified using the git add command: git add <filename> <filename> is the name of the file you just modified. And you can use the following command to add all the files in the current folder: git add . Next, you can commit these changes using the git commit command: git commit -m \"<commit message>\" -s Summarize and describe your modification briefly in the place of <commit message> . -s adds your sign-off message to your commit message. Step 6: Push to your remote repo After committing your modification, you should push your local branch to GitHub using the git push command, and we recommend you to push to a new branch: git push origin main:NEW_BRANCH NEW_BRANCH is the name of the new branch you created and push to. Also, you can replace it with another name you want. Step 7: Create a pull request Having pushed your changes, you can visit your folk at https://github.com/$user/matrixone , and click the Compare & Pull Request button to create a pull request in NEW_BRANCH for your modification to the MatrixOne repository.

When you are ready to commit, be sure to follow the style guide to write a good commit message, a good Pull Request title, and a description. Why a good commit message matters To speed up the reviewing process Help the reviewers better understand the PR Allow ignoring unimportant commits To help us write good Release Notes To help the future maintainers establish the context Provide better information when browsing the history What is a good commit message Elements of a good commit message: What is your change? (mandatory) It can be fixing a specific bug, adding a feature, improving performance, reliability, and stability, or just being a change for the sake of correctness. Why was this change made? (mandatory) For short and obvious patches, this part can be omitted, but it should be a clear description of what the approach was. What effect does the commit have? (optional) In addition to the obvious effects, this may include benchmarks, side effects, and so on. For short and obvious patches, this part can be omitted. How to write a good commit message To write a good commitment message, we suggest following a good format, cultivating good habits, and using good language. Format of a good commit message Please follow the following style for all your commits : <subsystem>: <what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made> <BLANK LINE> <footer>(optional) For the first subject line: Use no more than 70 characters. If the changes affect two subsystems, use a comma (and whitespace) to separate them like util/codec, util/types: . If the changes affect three or more subsystems, you can use * instead, like *: . Use a lowercase letter on the text that immediately follows the colon. For example: \"media: update the DM architecture image\" Do not add a period at the end of a commit message. For the second line, always leave it blank. For the why part, if there is no specific reason for the change, you can use one of the generic reasons like \"Improve performance\", \"Improve test coverage.\" For other lines, use no more than 80 characters. Habits for a good commit message Summarize your change Describe clearly one logical change and avoid lazy messages as misc fixes Describe any limitations of the current code Do not end the subject with a period \".\" Do not assume the code is self-evident Do not assume reviewers understand the original issue Language for a good commit message Use the imperative mood for the first subject line Use simple verb tenses (eg. use \"add\" not \"added\") Use correct and standard grammar Use words and expressions consistently Use relatively short sentences Do not use lengthy compound words Do not abbreviate unless it's absolutely necessary Pull Request description style For the Pull Request description in the Conversation box, please refer to the following Pull Request description template and include the necessary information: **What type of PR is this?** - [ ] API-change - [ ] BUG - [ ] Improvement - [ ] Documentation - [ ] Feature - [ ] Test and CI - [ ] Code Refactoring **Which issue(s) this PR fixes:** issue # **What this PR does / why we need it:** **Special notes for your reviewer:** **Additional documentation (e.g. design docs, usage docs, and so on.):** You may also use the checklist style to list contents if needed.

The MatrixOne community strives to make the contribution process simple and straightforward. To do that, we create this page to walk you through the whole process step by step. Before you start Before you contribute, please take a minute to familiarize yourself with basic Markdown syntax and look at our Code of Conduct and the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide for some guidance on writing accessible, consistent, and inclusive documentation. How is MatrixOne documentation project organized? The MatrixOne documentation is managed in 3 repositories: The english markdown contents are in the matrixorigin.io repo. The chinese markdown contents are in the matrixorigin.io.cn repo. The images and unstructured data are located in the artwork repo. The images are referred to as web image links from artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io and matrixorigin.io.cn have implemented a CI&CD project, which will be triggered by a new code merge and manual launch. This CI&CD workflow publishes the documentation to https://docs.matrixorigin.cn/en/ . The documentation project is based on the mkdocs-material . You can find the corresponding syntax and commands with this project. MatrixOne Documentation Structure The MatrixOne documentation content is planned with 6 main modules. Overview : MatrixOne's introduction, features and architecture. Getting Started : How to quickly deploy and run a standalone MatrixOne. Developing Guide : How to develop some applications based on MatrixOne using different programming languages. Deploying : How to quickly deploy and run MatrixOne cluster. Tutorials : Examples of developing application demos. Maintenance : How to maintain MatrixOne, including backing up and restoring data. Migrating : How to migrate data from other databases to MatrixOne. Testing : How to perform a self-test or MatrixOne performance test using the test tool. Performance Tuning : How to tune the MatrixOne performance in a stand-alone or distributed environment. Privilege : Multi-account management, account lifecycle management, and authorization in MatrixOne clusters. Reference : SQL reference, Configuration parameters. Troubleshooting : Introduce common errors and debugging tools. FAQs : Product, Technical Design, SQL, Deployment FAQs. Release Notes : Release notes of all versions. Contribution Guide : How to contribute to MatrixOne project. Glossary : Table of noun definitions. Lift a finger If you are correcting a typo or grammatical error, feel free to go ahead and create a pull request for English docs or create a pull request for Chinese docs . Contribute Workflow When you need to change the specific content of the document but do not involve the adjustment of the chapter order and structure organization, you need to modify matrixorigin.io/tree/main/docs/MatrixOne or matrixorigin.io.cn/tree/main/docs/MatrixOne to operate. If you need to adjust the chapter order and structure organization, you must modify the matrixorigin.io/blob/main/mkdocs.yml or matrixorigin.io.cn/blob/main/mkdocs.yml . The following process shows the case of modifying both, and the actual situation can be simplified according to your needs. 1 . File an English doc issue or File an Chinese doc issue and assign it to yourself by commenting /assign . 2 . Fork matrixorigin.io and matrixorigin.io.cn repos. 3 . Clone the matrixorigin.io and matrixorigin.io.cn repos. Clone matrixorigin.io : git clone git@github.com:yourusername/matrixorigin.io.git Clone the matrixorigin.io.cn : git clone git@github.com:yourusername/matrixorigin.io.cn.git 4 . Add matrixorigin.io and matrixorigin.io.cn repos as the remote repository in your local folder with: Add matrixorigin.io repo as a remote repository in your local matrixorigin.io folder with: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixorigin.io.git Add matrixorigin.io.cn repo as a remote repository in your local matrixorigin.io.cn folder with: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixorigin.io.cn.git 5 . As the local repo has the full documentation project code, you can run mkdocs serve under matrixorigin.io or matrixorigin.io.cn folder, and check http://localhost:8000 to check if this project runs well. mkdocs serve 6 . Make your modification. If the modification concerns the project settings, update the sitemap with new pages, or update the CI&CD workflow code. You can always check http://localhost:8000 to see if your modification is effective. 7 . Push your git commits to your remote Github matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. We recommend you push to a new branch using the following commands: git push origin main:NEW_BRANCH 8 . Go back to GitHub, and submit a pull request in NEW_BRANCH so that we can review your changes. 9 . Once your code for both repositories is merged, you'll wait for a CI&CD workflow to restart running until the documentation website being updated. Note So once your pull requests are merged, the update to the website is not immediate. We'll need to run a manual launch to update it. 10 . At last, you should update your local and remote repo to help keep committing history clean. Override your local committing repo with: git pull --force upstream main:main Update the main branch of your remote repo in Github: git push --force origin main:main Note Most processes should be implemented in both matrixorigin.io and matrixorigin.io.cn .

It's not necessary to doubt whether your review is constructive and useful enough because no matter how tiny, a suggestion may profoundly influence MatrixOne. Certainly, before reviewing we ask that you browse this page to learn basic requirements and relative methods. Principles of the code review When you review a pull request, there are several rules and suggestions you should take to propose better comments. Regardless of the specifics, we suggest you stay friendly first: Be respectful Be respectful to every pull request author and other reviewers. Code review is a part of community activities so you should follow the community requirements. Be careful with tone Try to frame your comments as suggestions or questions instead of commands. If the tone is softer, your reviews will be easier to accept. Be generous with your compliments We recommend you offer encouragement and appreciation to the authors for their good practices in the code segments. In many cases, telling the authors what they did is right is even more valuable than telling them what they did is wrong. Additionally, here are some suggestions in terms of content: Provide more We encourage you to provide additional details and context of your review process as much as you can. Undoubtedly, the more detailed your review, the more useful it will be to others. If you test the pull request, please report the result and your test environment details. If you request some changes, try to suggest how. Keep objective Avoid individual biased opinions and subjective emotions. Of course, everyone will comment with more or less subjective opinions. However, as a good reviewer, you should consider the technique and data facts rather than your own personal preferences. Case by case It's difficult to decide whether it's more reasonable to accept or reject when you are faced with a complex problem. Regrettably, we can't provide a certain answer because it always depends on the specific situation, which asks you to balance the pros and cons. Classifying pull requests Some pull request authors may not be familiar with MatrixOne, the MatriOne development workflow, or the MatrixOne community. They don't know what labels should be added to the pull requests or which expert could be asked for a review. If you are able to, it would be great for you to triage the pull requests, add suitable labels to the pull requests, and request corresponding experts to review the pull requests. These actions could help more contributors notice the pull requests and make quick responses. Checking pull requests There are some basic aspects to check when you review a pull request: Concentration One pull request should only do one thing. No matter how small it is, the change does exactly one thing and gets it right. Don't mix other changes into it. Tests A pull request should be test covered, whether the tests are unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. Tests should be sufficient, correct, and don't slow down the CI pipeline largely. Functionality The pull request should implement what the author intends to do, fit well in the existing code base, and resolve a real problem for users. Thus you should check whether or not the pull request achieves the intention and you could follow the discussions in the corresponding GitHub issue . Style Code in the pull request should follow a common programming style . However, sometimes the existing code is inconsistent with the style guide. You should maintain consistency with the existing code or file a new issue to fix the existing code style first. Documentation If a pull request changes how users build, test, interact with, or release code, you must check whether it also updates the related documentation such as README.md and any generated reference docs. Similarly, if a pull request deletes or deprecates code, you must check whether or not the corresponding documentation should also be deleted. Performance If you find the pull request may affect performance, you could ask the author to provide a benchmark result.","title":"Review a Pull Request"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/How-to-Contribute/review-a-pull-request/#reviews","text":"For MatrixOne, any type of review for a pull request is crucial, where you can classify the pull request to help look for more suitable experts to solve related problems or propose your suggestions to code for not only content but style.

The CRDs contained in MatrixOne Operator register various custom resources, including MatrixOneCluster resources used to describe MatrixOne clusters and resources such as CNSet, DNSet, and LogSet used to describe components in the cluster. After the registration, the client can read and write these resources on the Kubernetes APIServer. Controller : The controller is a long-running automation program responsible for monitoring the desired state of resources in Kubernetes, collecting the actual state of these resources, and automatically operating and maintaining them to drive the actual state to the desired state. The controller in matrixone-operator monitors resources such as MatrixOneCluster, CNSet, DNSet, LogSet, etc., and is responsible for realizing the desired state declared by the user through these resources. Webhook service : A webhook service is a long-running HTTP service. When Kubernetes APIServer receives a request from a user to read and write resources such as MatrixOneCluster, CNSet, DNSet, and LogSet, it will forward the request to the Webhook service, and the Webhook service will perform logic such as request verification and default value filling. When using Helm chart to install Matrixone-Operator, it will automatically submit the required CRDs to Kubernetes APIServer, complete the registration of custom resources, and deploy a long-running Matrixone-Operator application. The controller mentioned above, and webhook services are packaged in this application. Cluster Management MatrixOne Operator provides users with declarative cluster management capabilities through MatrixOneCluster resources. Specifically, when deploying a MatrixOne cluster on Kubernetes, the user can declare a MatrixOneCluster object in YAML format to describe the cluster, and the controller of the operator will realize the orchestration of the cluster according to the description and update the cluster status to the .status of the MatrixOneCluster object field. A MatrixOneCluster cluster consists of components such as Compute Node (CN), Database Node (DN), and Log Service, which correspond to sub-resources such as CNSet, DNSet, and LogSet. Therefore, the controller of the MatrixOneCluster resource orchestrates these sub-resources and relies on the controllers of these sub-resources to complete their orchestration. Deployment, Operation, Maintenance The deployment, operation, and maintenance environment introduced in this chapter will be based on the environment of MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Deployment . The following operations are performed on the master0 node. Deployment Please look at the MatrixOne-Operator deployment chapter of MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Deployment . Check Status We use the Helm tool to deploy MatrixOne Operator. Helm is a Kubernetes application package management tool for managing charts, pre-configured installation package resources, similar to Ubuntu's APT and CentOS YUM. You can use the helm list command to check the deployment status of the Operator.

Generally speaking, we only need to consider horizontal scaling, increasing or decreasing the number of replicas. Usually, the Operator has a single copy. If we need to enhance the high availability of the Operator, consider expanding it, for example, to two copies. This way, even if the first replica fails (for example, pulling an image fails on its node), the other replica can still function normally. We can expand and shrink the number of Operator replicas by using the Helm Upgrade command and specifying the number of replicaCount in the deployment directory of the current Operator version. This is very important for the deployment and O&M management operations of MO clusters.

You can do this with the kubectl top command. For more detailed operation steps, please refer to Health Check and Resource Monitoring . In general, if the resource usage of a node or Pod exceeds 60% and lasts for some time, consider expanding capacity to cope with the peak load. In addition, capacity expansion operations must also be considered if a high TPS request volume is observed according to business indicators. Scaling Kubernetes Kubernetes manages and allocates essential hardware resources in the distributed MatrixOne cluster. Kubernetes can expand or contract the hardware nodes in the cluster using the kuboard spray graphical management page. For more information on tutorials, see kuboard spray official documents . You need to add a working node to the cluster, and the overall hardware configuration resources are shown in the following table: Host Internal IP External IP mem CPU Disk Role kuboardspray 10.206.0.6 1.13.2.100 2G 2C 50G \u8df3\u677f\u673a master0 10.206.134.8 118.195.255.252 8G 2C 50G master etcd node0 10.206.134.14 1.13.13.199 8G 2C 50G worker node1 10.206.134.16 129.211.211.29 8G 2C 50G worker Scaling MatrixOne Services Scaling of services refers to expanding or contracting the core component services within the MatrixOne cluster, such as Log Service, DN, and CN. Based on the architectural characteristics of MatrixOne, the following conditions apply to these service nodes: Log Service has only 3 nodes. DN has only 1 node. The number of CN nodes is flexible. Therefore, scaling of Log Service and DN nodes is possible only through vertical scaling. However, CN nodes can be scaled both vertically and horizontally. Horizontal scaling Horizontal scaling refers to the increase or decrease in the number of copies of a service. You can change the number of service replicas by modifying the value of the .spec.[component].replicas field in the MatrixOne Operator startup yaml file. Use the following command to activate the value of the .spec.[component].replicas field in the yaml file: kubectl edit matrixonecluster ${mo_cluster_name} -n ${mo_ns} Enter edit mode: tp: replicas: 2 #Changed from 1 CN to 2 CNs #Other content is ignored After editing the number of replicas , saving, and exiting, MatrixOne Operator will automatically start a new CN.

You can view the number of connections on each CN through the built-in system_metrics.server_connections table of MatrixOne. Vertical scaling Vertical scaling refers to the resources required to serve a copy of a single component, such as adjusting CPU or memory. Use the following command to modify the configuration of requests and limits in the corresponding component's .spec.[component].resources . The example is as follows: kubectl edit matrixonecluster ${mo_cluster_name} -n ${mo_ns} Enter edit mode: metadata: name: mo # content omitted spec: tp: resources: requests: cpu: 1 memory: 2Gi limits: cpu: 1 memory: 2Gi ... # content omitted Node Scheduling By default, Matrixone-operator does not configure topology rules for each component's Pod but uses Kubernetes' default scheduler to schedule according to each Pod's resource request. If you need to set specific scheduling rules, such as scheduling the cn component to two specific nodes, node0, and node1, you can follow the steps below: Set labels for node0 and node1 . Set nodeSelector in the MatrixOne cluster so the service can be scheduled to the corresponding node. (Optional) Set the TopologySpread field in the MatrixOne cluster to achieve an even distribution of services across nodes. Set the number of replicas replicas in the MatrixOne cluster. Set node label Execute the following command to view the status of the cluster nodes: [root@master0 ~]# kubectl get node NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION master0 Ready control-plane,master 47h v1.23.17 node0 Ready <none> 47h v1.23.17 node1 Ready <none> 65s v1.23.17 According to the above-returned results and actual needs, you can label the nodes; see the following code example: NODE=\"[node to be labeled]\" # According to the above results, it may be IP, hostname, or alias, such as 10.0.0.1, host-10-0-0-1, node01, then set NODE = \"node0\" LABEL_K=\"mo-role\" # The key of the label, which can be defined on demand, or can be directly used as an example LABEL_V=\"mo-cn\" # The value of the label, which can be defined as needed, or can be directly used as an example kubectl label node ${NODE} ${LABEL_K}=${LABEL_V} In this case, you can also write the following two statements: kubectl label node node0 \"mo-role\"=\"mo-cn\" kubectl label node node1 \"mo-role\"=\"mo-cn\" Use the following command to confirm that the node label is printed: [root@master0 ~]# kubectl get node node0 --show-labels | grep mo_role node0 Ready <none> 47h v1.23.17 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=node0,kubernetes.io/os=linux,mo_role=mo_cn [root@master0 ~]# kubectl get node node1 --show-labels | grep mo_role node1 Ready <none> 7m25s v1.23.17 beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=node1,kubernetes.io/os=linux,mo_role=mo_cn Execute the following command to delete tags as needed: kubectl label node ${NODE} ${LABEL_K}- Set service scheduling rules, uniform distribution, and number of copies Execute the following command to view the current distribution of Pods on multiple nodes: [root@master0 mo]# kubectl get pod -nmo-hn -owide NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES mo-dn-0 1/1 Running 0 34m 10.234.60.120 node0 <none> 2/2 mo-log-0 1/1 Running 0 34m 10.234.168.72 node1 <none> 2/2 mo-log-1 1/1 Running 0 34m 10.234.60.118 node0 <none> 2/2 mo-log-2 1/1 Running 0 34m 10.234.168.73 node1 <none> 2/2 mo-tp-cn-0 1/1 Running 0 33m 10.234.168.75 node1 <none> 2/2 According to the above output and actual requirements, it can be seen that there is only one CN at present, and we need to set the scheduling rules for the CN component. We will modify it in the properties of the MatrixOne cluster object. The new CN will be scheduled to node0 under the rule of uniform distribution within the scheduling scope. Execute the following command to enter edit mode: mo_ns=\"mo-hn\" mo_cluster_name=\"mo\" # The general name is mo, specified by the name in the yaml file of the matrixonecluster object during deployment, or confirmed by kubectl get matrixonecluster -n${mo_ns} kubectl edit matrixonecluster ${mo_cluster_name} -n ${mo_ns} In edit mode, according to the above scenario, we will set the number of copies of CN to 2 and schedule on nodes labeled mo-role:mo-cn to achieve uniform distribution within the scheduling range. We will use spec.[component].nodeSelector to specify the tag selector for a specific component. Here is the edited content of the example: metadata: name: mo # Intermediate content omitted spec: # Intermediate content omitted tp: # Set the number of replicas replicas: 2 # Set scheduling rules nodeSelector: mo-role: mo-cn # Set the uniform distribution within the scheduling range topologySpread: - topology.kubernetes.io/zone - kubernetes.io/hostname #Other content omitted After the change takes effect, execute the following command to check that the two CNs are already on the two nodes: [root@master0 ~]# kubectl get pod -nmo-hn -owide NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES mo-dn-0 1/1 Running 1 (2m53s ago) 3m6s 10.234.168.80 node1 <none> 2/2 mo-log-0 1/1 Running 0 3m40s 10.234.168.78 node1 <none> 2/2 mo-log-1 1/1 Running 0 3m40s 10.234.60.122 node0 <none> 2/2 mo-log-2 1/1 Running 0 3m40s 10.234.168.77 node1 <none> 2/2 mo-tp-cn-0 1/1 Running 0 84s 10.234.60.125 node0 <none> 2/2 mo-tp-cn-1 1/1 Running 0 86s 10.234.168.82 node1 <none> 2/2 It should be noted that the configuration in the above example will make the Pods in the cluster evenly distributed on the two dimensions topology.kubernetes.io/zone and kubernetes.io/hostname . The tag keys specified in topologySpread are ordered. In the example above, Pods is first distributed evenly across the Availability Zones dimension, and then Pods within each Availability Zone are evenly distributed across the nodes within that zone. Using the topologySpread function can increase the availability of the cluster and reduce the possibility of destroying the majority of replicas in the cluster due to a single point or regional failure. But this also increases the scheduling requirements and the need to ensure that the cluster has enough resources available in each region.","title":"Scaling"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Deploy/MatrixOne-cluster-Scale/#scaling-matrixone-cluster","text":"This document will introduce how to scale the MatrixOne cluster, including the Kubernetes cluster and scaling of individual MatrixOne services.

The tag keys specified in topologySpread are ordered. In the example above, Pods is first distributed evenly across the Availability Zones dimension, and then Pods within each Availability Zone are evenly distributed across the nodes within that zone. Using the topologySpread function can increase the availability of the cluster and reduce the possibility of destroying the majority of replicas in the cluster due to a single point or regional failure.

Main Steps Deploy Kubernetes cluster Deploy object storage MinIO Create and connect MatrixOne cluster Key Concepts As this document involves many Kubernetes-related terms, to help everyone understand the deployment process, we will provide brief explanations of important terms related to Kubernetes. If you need to know more about Kubernetes-related content, see Kubernetes Documentation Pod Pod is the smallest resource management component in Kubernetes and the smallest resource object for running containerized applications. A Pod represents a process running in the cluster. In simple terms, we can consider a group of applications that provide specific functions as a pod containing one or more container objects that work together to provide services to the outside world. Storage Class Storage Class, abbreviated as SC, marks the characteristics and performance of storage resources. According to the description of SC, we can intuitively understand the aspects of various storage resources and then apply storage resources according to the application's requirements. Administrators can define storage resources as a specific category, just as storage devices describe their configuration profiles. CSI Kubernetes provides the CSI interface (Container Storage Interface, Container Storage Interface). Based on this set of CSI interfaces, custom CSI plug-ins can be developed to support specific storage and achieve the purpose of decoupling. PersistentVolume PersistentVolume, abbreviated as PV, mainly includes setting key information such as storage capacity, access mode, storage type, recycling strategy, and backend storage type as a storage resource. PersistentVolumeClaim PersistentVolumeClaim, or PVC, is used as a user's request for storage resources, mainly including the setting of information such as storage space request, access mode, PV selection conditions, and storage category. Service Also called SVC , it matches a group of Pods to external access services through label selection. Each svc can be understood as a microservice. Operator Kubernetes Operator is a way to package, deploy and manage Kubernetes applications. We use the Kubernetes API (Application Programming Interface) and the Kubectl tool to deploy and manage Kubernetes applications on Kubernetes. Deployment Architecture Dependent components MatrixOne distributed system depends on the following components: Kubernetes: As a resource management platform for the entire MatrixOne cluster, components such as Logservice, CN, and DN all run in Pods managed by Kubernetes. In the event of a failure, Kubernetes will cull the failed Pod and start a new one to replace it. Minio: Provides object storage services for the entire MatrixOne cluster, and all MatrixOne data is stored in the object storage provided by Minio. Additionally, for container management and orchestration on Kubernetes, we need the following plugins: Helm: Helm is a package management tool for managing Kubernetes applications, similar to APT for Ubuntu and YUM for CentOS. It is used to manage pre-configured installation package resources called Charts. local-path-provisioner: As a plug-in that implements the CSI (Container Storage Interface) interface in Kubernetes, local-path-provisioner is responsible for creating persistent volumes (PVs) for Pods and Minios of MatrixOne components to achieve data persistence storage. Overall structure The overall deployment architecture is shown in the following figure: The overall architecture consists of the following components: The bottom layer is three server nodes: the first host1 is the springboard machine for installing Kubernetes, the second is the master node (master) of Kubernetes, and the third is Kubernetes' working node (node). The installed Kubernetes and Docker environment is the upper layer, which constitutes the cloud-native platform layer. A Kubernetes plugin layer for management based on Helm, including the local-path-storage plugin implementing the CSI interface, Minio, and the MatrixOne Operator. The topmost layer is several Pods and Services generated by these component configurations. Pod and storage architecture of MatrixOne MatrixOne creates a series of Kubernetes objects according to the rules of the Operator, and these objects are classified according to components and classified into resource groups, namely CNSet, DNSet, and LogSet. Service: The services in each resource group must be provided externally through the Service. Service hosts the external connection function to ensure the service can still be provided when the Pod crashes or is replaced. External applications connect through the Service's exposed ports, and the Service forwards connections to the corresponding Pods through internal forwarding rules. Pod: A containerized instance of MatrixOne components in which MatrixOne's core kernel code runs. PVC: Each Pod declares the storage resources it needs through PVC (Persistent Volume Claim). In our architecture, CN and DN must apply for a storage resource as a cache, and LogService requires corresponding S3 resources. These requirements are declared through PVCs. PV: PV (Persistent Volume) is an abstract representation of storage media, which can be regarded as a storage unit. After applying for a PVC, create a PV through software that implements the CSI interface and binds it to the PVC used for resources. 1. Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster As MatrixOne's distributed deployment relies on a Kubernetes cluster, we need to have one in place. This article will guide you through setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Kuboard-Spray. Preparing the Cluster Environment To prepare the cluster environment, you need to do the following: Have three virtual machines Use CentOS 7.9 as the operating system (by default, it does allow root account remote login). Two machines will be used for deploying Kubernetes and other dependencies for MatrixOne, while the third will act as a jump host to set up the Kubernetes cluster. External network access conditions. The three servers all need to pull the external network image. The specific distribution of the machines is shown below: Host Intranet IP Extranet IP mem CPU Disk Role kuboardspray 10.206.0.6 1.13.2.100 2G 2C 50G \u8df3\u677f\u673a master0 10.206.134.8 118.195.255.252 8G 2C 50G master etcd node0 10.206.134.14 1.13.13.199 8G 2C 50G worker Deploying Kuboard Spray on a Jump Server Kuboard Spray is a tool used for visualizing the deployment of Kubernetes clusters. It uses Docker to quickly launch a web application that can visualize the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster. Once the Kubernetes cluster environment has been deployed, the Docker application can be stopped. Preparing the Jump Server Environment Install Docker: A Docker environment is required. Install and start Docker on the springboard machine with the following commands: curl -sSL https://get.docker.io/ | sh #If you are in a domestic network restricted environment, you can change the following domestic mirror address curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun Start Docker: [root@VM-0-6-centos ~]# systemctl start docker [root@VM-0-6-centos ~]# systemctl status docker \u25cf docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Sun 2023-05-07 11:48:06 CST; 15s ago Docs: https://docs.docker.com Main PID: 5845 (dockerd) Tasks: 8 Memory: 27.8M CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service \u2514\u25005845 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock May 07 11:48:06 VM-0-6-centos systemd[1]: Starting Docker Application Container Engine...

Deploying Kuboard Spray Execute the following command to install Kuboard Spray: docker run -d \\ --privileged \\ --restart=unless-stopped \\ --name=kuboard-spray \\ -p 80:80/tcp \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ -v ~/kuboard-spray-data:/data \\ eipwork/kuboard-spray:latest-amd64 If the image pull fails due to network issues, use the backup address below: docker run -d \\ --privileged \\ --restart=unless-stopped \\ --name=kuboard-spray \\ -p 80:80/tcp \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ -v ~/kuboard-spray-data:/data \\ swr.cn-east-2.myhuaweicloud.com/kuboard/kuboard-spray:latest-amd64 After executing the command, open the Kuboard Spray web interface by entering http://1.13.2.100 (jump server IP address) in a web browser, then log in to the Kuboard Spray interface using the username admin and the default password Kuboard123 , as shown below: After logging in, the Kubernetes cluster deployment can be started. Visual Deployment of Kubernetes Cluster After logging into the Kuboard-Spray interface, you can begin visually deploying a Kubernetes cluster. Importing Kubernetes-related Resource Packages The installation interface will download the Kubernetes cluster's corresponding resource package via online downloading to achieve offline installation of the Kubernetes cluster. Click Resource Package Management and select the appropriate version of the Kubernetes resource package to download: Download spray-v2.18.0b-2_k8s-v1.23.17_v1.24-amd64 \u7248\u672c Click Import > Load Resource Package , select the appropriate download source, and wait for the resource package to finish downloading. This will pull the related image dependencies: After the image resource package is successfully pulled, return to the Kuboard-Spray web interface. You can see that the corresponding version of the resource package has been imported. Installing a Kubernetes Cluster This chapter will guide you through the installation of a Kubernetes cluster. Select Cluster Management and choose Add Cluster Installation Plan : In the pop-up dialog box, define the name of the cluster, select the version of the resource package that was just imported, and click OK , as shown in the following figure: Cluster Planning Based on the predefined roles, the Kubernetes cluster is deployed with a pattern of 1 master + 1 worker + 1 etcd. After defining the cluster name and selecting the resource package version, click OK , and then proceed to the cluster planning stage. Select the corresponding node roles and names: Master node: Select the etcd and control node and name it master0. (If you want the master node to participate in the work, you can select the worker node simultaneously. This method can improve resource utilization but will reduce the high availability of Kubernetes.) Worker node: Select only the worker node and name it node0. After filling in the roles and node names for each node, please fill in the corresponding connection information on the right, as shown in the following figure: After filling in all the roles, click Save . You can now prepare to install the Kubernetes cluster. Installing Kubernetes Cluster After completing all roles and saving in the previous step, click Execute to start installing the Kubernetes cluster. Click OK as shown in the figure below to start installing the Kubernetes cluster: When installing the Kubernetes cluster, the ansible script will be executed on the corresponding node to install the Kubernetes cluster. The overall installation time will vary depending on the machine configuration and network. Generally, it takes 5 to 10 minutes. Note: If an error occurs, you can check the log to confirm whether the version of Kuboard-Spray is mismatched. If the version is mismatched, please replace it with a suitable version. After the installation is complete, execute kubectl get node on the master node of the Kubernetes cluster: [root@master0 ~]# kubectl get node NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION master0 Ready control-plane,master 52m v1.23.17 node0 Ready <none> 52m v1.23.17 The command result shown in the figure above indicates that the Kubernetes cluster has been successfully installed. Adjust the DNS routing table on each node in Kubernetes. Please execute the following command on each machine to find the nameserver containing 169.254.25.10 and delete the record. (This record may affect the communication efficiency between Pods) vim 2. Deploying Helm Helm is a package management tool for managing Kubernetes applications. Similar to APT for Ubuntu and YUM for CentOS, Helm provides a convenient way to install, upgrade, and manage Kubernetes applications. It simplifies the application deployment and management process using charts (preconfigured installation package resources). Before installing Minio, we need to install Helm first because the installation process of Minio depends on Helm. Here are the steps to install Helm: Note: All operations in this section are performed on the master0 node. Download the Helm installation package: wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.10.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz #You can use the following domestic mirror address if the trained network is limited. wget https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/helm/v3.10.2/helm-v3.10.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz Extract and install: tar -zxf helm-v3.10.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm Verify the version to check if it is installed: [root@k8s01 home]# helm version version.BuildInfo{Version:\"v3.10.2\", GitCommit:\"50f003e5ee8704ec937a756c646870227d7c8b58\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", GoVersion:\"go1.18.8\"} The version information shown above indicates that the installation is complete. 3. CSI Deployment CSI is a storage plugin for Kubernetes that provides storage services for MinIO and MatrixOne. This section will guide you through the use of the local-path-provisioner plugin. Note: All the commands in this section should be executed on the master0 node. Install CSI using the following command line: wget https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.23.zip unzip v0.0.23.zip cd local-path-provisioner-0.0.23/deploy/chart/local-path-provisioner helm install --set nodePathMap[0].paths[0]=\"/opt/local-path-provisioner\",nodePathMap[0].node=DEFAULT_PATH_FOR_NON_LISTED_NODES --create-namespace --namespace local-path-storage local-path-storage ./ After a successful installation, the command line should display as follows: root@master0:~# kubectl get pod -n local-path-storage NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE local-path-storage-local-path-provisioner-57bf67f7c-lcb88 1/1 Running 0 89s Note: After installation, this storageClass will provide storage services in the \"/opt/local-path-provisioner\" directory on the worker node. You can modify it to another path. Set the default storageClass : kubectl patch storageclass local-path -p '{\"metadata\": {\"annotations\":{\"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class\":\"true\"}}}' After setting the default, the command line should display as follows: root@master0:~# kubectl get storageclass NAME PROVISIONER RECLAIMPOLICY VOLUMEBINDINGMODE ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION AGE local-path (default) cluster.local/local-path-storage-local-path-provisioner Delete WaitForFirstConsumer true 115s 4. MinIO Deployment MinIO is used to provide object storage for MatrixOne. This section will guide you through the deployment of a single-node MinIO. Note: All the commands in this section should be executed on the master0 node. Installation and Startup The command line for installing and starting MinIO is as follows: helm repo add minio https://charts.min.io/ mkdir minio_ins && cd minio_ins helm fetch minio/minio ls -lth tar minio-5.0.9.tgz # This version may change; the actual download shall prevail cd ./minio/ kubectl create ns mostorage helm install minio \\ --namespace mostorage \\ --set resources.requests.memory=512Mi \\ --set replicas=1 \\ --set persistence.size=10G \\ --set mode=standalone \\ --set rootUser=rootuser,rootPassword=rootpass123 \\ --set consoleService.type=NodePort \\ --set image.repository=minio/minio \\ --set image.tag=latest \\ --set mcImage.repository=minio/mc \\ --set mcImage.tag=latest \\ -f values.yaml minio/minio Note --set resources.requests.memory=512Mi sets the minimum memory consumption of MinIO --set persistence.size=1G sets the storage size of MinIO to 1G --set rootUser=rootuser,rootPassword=rootpass123 the parameters set for rootUser and rootPassword are required for creating the secrets file for the Kubernetes cluster later, so use something that you can remember. If it is repeatedly executed due to network or other reasons, it needs to be uninstalled first: helm uninstall minio --namespace most storage After a successful installation and start, the command line should display as follows: NAME: minio LAST DEPLOYED: Sun May 7 14:17:18 2023 NAMESPACE: most storage STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: MinIO can be accessed via port 9000 on the following DNS name from within your cluster: minio.mostorage.svc.cluster.local To access MinIO from localhost, run the following commands: 1. export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace moststorage -l \"release=minio\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") 2. kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 9000 --namespace most storage Read more about port forwarding here: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_port-forward/ You can now access MinIO server on http://localhost:9000. Follow the below steps to connect to MinIO server with mc client: 1. Download the MinIO mc client - https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart 2. export MC_HOST_minio-local=http://$(kubectl get secret --namespace most storage minio -o jsonpath=\"{.data.rootUser}\" | base64 --decode):$(kubectl get secret --namespace most storage minio -o jsonpath=\"{.data.rootPassword}\" | base64 --decode)@localhost:9000 3. mc ls minio-local So far, Minio has been successfully installed. During the subsequent installation of MatrixOne, MatrixOne will communicate with Minio directly through the Kubernetes Service (SVC) without additional configuration. However, if you want to connect to Minio from localhost , you can execute the following command line to set the POD_NAME variable and connect mostorage to port 9000: export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace mostorage -l \"release=minio\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") nohup kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 $POD_NAME -n mostorage 9000:9000 & After startup, use http://118.195.255.252:32001/ to log in to the MinIO page and create object storage information. As shown in the figure below, the account password is the rootUser and rootPassword set by --set rootUser=rootuser,rootPassword=rootpass123 in the above steps: After logging in, you need to create object storage related information: Fill in the Bucket Name with minio-mo under Bucket > Create Bucket . After filling it in, click the Create Bucket button at the bottom right. 5. Deploying a MatrixOne Cluster This section will guide you through the process of deploying a MatrixOne cluster. Note: All steps in this section are performed on the master0 node. Installing the MatrixOne-Operator MatrixOne Operator is a standalone software tool for deploying and managing MatrixOne clusters on Kubernetes. You can install the latest Operator Release installation package from the project's Release List . Follow the steps below to install MatrixOne Operator on master0. We will create a separate namespace, matrixone-operator for the Operator. Download the latest MatrixOne Operator installation package: wget https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone-operator/releases/download/chart-0.8.0-alpha.2/matrixone-operator-0.8.0-alpha.2.tgz Unzip the installation package: tar -xvf matrixone-operator-0.8.0-alpha.2.tgz cd /root/matrixone-operator/ Define the namespace variable: NS=\"matrixone-operator\" Use Helm to install MatrixOne Operator and create a namespace: helm install --create-namespace --namespace ${NS} matrixone-operator ./ --dependency-update After the installation is successful, use the following command to confirm the installation status: kubectl get pod -n matrixone-operator Ensure all pods have a running status in the above command output. [root@master0 matrixone-operator]# kubectl get pod -n matrixone-operator NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE matrixone-operator-f8496ff5c-fp6zm 1/1 Running 0 3m26s As shown in the above line of code, the status of the corresponding Pods is normal. Create a MatrixOne cluster First, create the namespace of MatrixOne: NS=\"mo-hn\" kubectl create ns ${NS} Customize the yaml file of the MatrixOne cluster, and write the following mo.yaml file: apiVersion: core.matrixorigin.io/v1alpha1 kind: MatrixOneCluster metadata: name: mo namespace: mo-hn spec: # 1.

Execute the following command to create a Secret service for accessing MinIO in the namespace mo-hn : kubectl -n mo-hn create secret generic minio --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=rootuser --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=rootpass123 The username and password use the rootUser and rootPassword set when creating the MinIO cluster. Execute the following command to deploy the MatrixOne cluster: kubectl apply -f mo.yaml Please wait patiently for about 10 minutes. If the Pod restarts, please continue to wait. Until you see the following information, the deployment is successful: [root@master0 mo]# kubectl get pods -n mo-hn NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE mo-dn-0 1/1 Running 0 74s mo-log-0 1/1 Running 1 (25s ago) 2m2s mo-log-1 1/1 Running 1 (24s ago) 2m2s mo-log-2 1/1 Running 1 (22s ago) 2m2s mo-tp-cn-0 1/1 Running 0 50s 6. Connect to MatrixOne cluster To connect to the MatrixOne cluster, you need to map the port of the corresponding service to the MatrixOne node. Here are the instructions for connecting to a MatrixOne cluster using kubectl port-forward : Only allow local access: nohup kubectl port-forward -nmo-hn svc/mo-tp-cn 6001:6001 & Specify a specific machine or all machines to access: nohup kubectl port-forward -nmo-hn --address 0.0.0.0 svc/mo-tp-cn 6001:6001 & After specifying Allow local access or Specify a specific machine or all machines to access , you can use the MySQL client to connect to MatrixOne: # Connect to the MySQL server using the 'mysql' command line tool # Use 'kubectl get svc/mo-tp-cn -n mo-hn -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}' ' to get the cluster IP address of the service in the Kubernetes cluster # The '-h' parameter specifies the hostname or IP address of the MySQL service # The '-P' parameter specifies the port number of the MySQL service, here is 6001 # '-uroot' means log in with root user # '-p111' means the initial password is 111 mysql -h $(kubectl get svc/mo-tp-cn -n mo-hn -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}') -P 6001 -uroot -p111 mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

If you need to know more about Kubernetes-related content, see Kubernetes Documentation Pod Pod is the smallest resource management component in Kubernetes and the smallest resource object for running containerized applications. A Pod represents a process running in the cluster. In simple terms, we can consider a group of applications that provide specific functions as a pod containing one or more container objects that work together to provide services to the outside world. Storage Class Storage Class, abbreviated as SC, marks the characteristics and performance of storage resources. According to the description of SC, we can intuitively understand the aspects of various storage resources and then apply storage resources according to the application's requirements. Administrators can define storage resources as a specific category, just as storage devices describe their configuration profiles. CSI Kubernetes provides the CSI interface (Container Storage Interface, Container Storage Interface). Based on this set of CSI interfaces, custom CSI plug-ins can be developed to support specific storage and achieve the purpose of decoupling. PersistentVolume PersistentVolume, abbreviated as PV, mainly includes setting key information such as storage capacity, access mode, storage type, recycling strategy, and backend storage type as a storage resource. PersistentVolumeClaim PersistentVolumeClaim, or PVC, is used as a user's request for storage resources, mainly including the setting of information such as storage space request, access mode, PV selection conditions, and storage category. Service Also called SVC , it matches a group of Pods to external access services through label selection. Each svc can be understood as a microservice.

Minio: Provides object storage services for the entire MatrixOne cluster, and all MatrixOne data is stored in the object storage provided by Minio.

Service: The services in each resource group must be provided externally through the Service. Service hosts the external connection function to ensure the service can still be provided when the Pod crashes or is replaced. External applications connect through the Service's exposed ports, and the Service forwards connections to the corresponding Pods through internal forwarding rules. Pod: A containerized instance of MatrixOne components in which MatrixOne's core kernel code runs. PVC: Each Pod declares the storage resources it needs through PVC (Persistent Volume Claim). In our architecture, CN and DN must apply for a storage resource as a cache, and LogService requires corresponding S3 resources. These requirements are declared through PVCs.

Follow the below steps to connect to MinIO server with mc client: 1. Download the MinIO mc client - https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart 2. export MC_HOST_minio-local=http://$(kubectl get secret --namespace most storage minio -o jsonpath=\"{.data.rootUser}\" | base64 --decode):$(kubectl get secret --namespace most storage minio -o jsonpath=\"{.data.rootPassword}\" | base64 --decode)@localhost:9000 3. mc ls minio-local So far, Minio has been successfully installed. During the subsequent installation of MatrixOne, MatrixOne will communicate with Minio directly through the Kubernetes Service (SVC) without additional configuration. However, if you want to connect to Minio from localhost , you can execute the following command line to set the POD_NAME variable and connect mostorage to port 9000: export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace mostorage -l \"release=minio\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") nohup kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 $POD_NAME -n mostorage 9000:9000 & After startup, use http://118.195.255.252:32001/ to log in to the MinIO page and create object storage information.

By checking MatrixOneCluster, we can tell if the cluster is functioning correctly.

But there are also some special cases where the Pod status may be Running, but the MatrixOne cluster is abnormal. For example, connecting to a MatrixOne cluster through a MySQL client is impossible. In this case, you can look further into the Pod's logs to check for unusual output. NS=\"mo-hn\" POD_NAME=\"[the name of the pod returned above]\" # For example, mo-tp-cn-0 kubectl logs ${POD_NAME} -n ${NS} If the Pod status is not Running, such as Pending, you can check the Pod events (Events) to confirm the cause of the exception. Taking the previous example, because the cluster resources cannot satisfy the request of mo-tp-cn-3 , the Pod cannot be scheduled and is Pending. In this case, you can solve it by expanding node resources. kubectl describe pod ${POD_NAME} -n${NS}","title":"Health check and resource monitoring"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Deploy/health-check-resource-monitoring/#health-check-and-resource-monitoring","text":"In the MatrixOne distributed cluster, there are multiple components and objects.

Before the actual operation, let's understand the architecture of the entire call link. Minio Access Architecture Logically speaking, MatrixOne communicates with Minio through Minio's access port endpoint and obtains data from it, as shown in the following figure: Minio is managed in Kubernetes (K8s), and external services must be accessed through the Service (SVC) of K8s. The actual execution of tasks is done in K8s Pods. SVC can ensure that the same port is always maintained for external applications no matter how the Pod changes. The association between SVC and Pod needs to establish rules through the Endpoint (EP) in K8s. Therefore, MatrixOne is connected to the Minio service through SVC and the specific architecture is shown in the following figure: Actual command When we installed Minio, we created a namespace named mostorage. We can find this endpoint through the following K8s commands. kubectl get svc -n ${ns} : List all SVCs under this namespace. kubectl get pod -n${ns} : List all Pods under this namespace. kubectl get ep -n ${ns} : List all forwarding rule relationships under this namespace.

It can achieve account and load isolation, among other functionalities, through traffic proxying and forwarding. For the technical design of the Proxy, refer to Detailed Proxy Architecture . This document primarily explains using Proxy to establish different CN groups for independent resource management of accounts and loads. System Architecture As illustrated below, users first connect to the Proxy module. Based on the identity and label information in the user connection string, the Proxy component distributes the user's database connection to the corresponding CN group. Other CN groups will not receive this user connection nor participate in the computation process related to this connection. A CN group is a logical CN group composed of CN nodes with the same attributes and size. It is a unit in the MatrixOne cluster used to isolate different resource groups. Each CN group can contain from 1 to infinite CN nodes and can use a series of labels to define its attributes. For example, determining the Account label corresponding to an account and forwarding the connection to a CN group with corresponding labels can realize account resource and business load isolation. With the feature that CN nodes in a CN group can scale horizontally indefinitely, an independent expansion for accounts or specified loads can be achieved. To ensure the high availability of Proxy, at least 2 replicas should be set up in the cluster. Steps The environment discussed in this document for managing CN groups using Proxy is based on the environment of MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Deployment . To help you understand resource isolation and allocation, you can refer to the table below, which illustrates the distribution of each hardware node in the environment of MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Deployment , as follows: Host Internal IP External IP Memory CPU Disk Role kuboardspray 10.206.0.6 1.13.2.100 2G 2C 50G Jump server master0 10.206.134.8 118.195.255.252 8G 2C 50G master etcd node0 10.206.134.14 1.13.13.199 8G 2C 50G worker Step One: Enable Proxy To enable the Proxy component in the MatrixOne distributed cluster, you need to specify the required Proxy topology when creating the cluster, or after adding the Proxy topology to the existing cluster, execute kubectl apply to enable the Proxy component. The detailed steps are as follows: Modify the mo.yaml file of the MatrixOne cluster: metadata: name: mo namespace: mo-hn spec: + proxy: + replicas: 2 # For high availability, at least 2 replicas are required for the Proxy After the modifications, run the mo.yaml file using the command below: kubectl apply -f mo.yaml Run kubectl get pod -nmo-hn to check if the Proxy has started properly: root@HOST-10-206-134-16:~# kubectl get pod -nmo-hn NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE mo-dn-0 1/1 Running 0 2m51s mo-log-0 1/1 Running 0 3m25s mo-log-1 1/1 Running 0 3m25s mo-log-2 1/1 Running 0 3m25s mo-proxy-69zjf 1/1 Running 0 2m51s mo-proxy-fpn2g 1/1 Running 0 2m51s mo-tp-cn-0 1/1 Running 0 2m25s The code example for a successful start is shown above.

You can query the system table system_metrics.server_connections to view the number of user connections on each CN. Step Two: Set Up CN Groups In the mo.yaml file of the MatrixOne cluster, you need to configure CN groups by setting the cnGroups field and configure the cnLabels field in each cnGroups to set the labels of all CNs in the CN group. The Proxy will route and forward according to the connection labels. For example, you have set up two CN groups named cnSet1 and cnSet2 in the following example. Each CN group can have an independent number of replicas, log levels, CN parameter configurations, and CN labels. The labels of CN groups adopt one-to-many groups of Key/value formats, in which there is a one-to-many relationship between each group of Key and value, i.e., each Key can have multiple values. The detailed steps are as follows: Refer to the configuration parameter example below to configure the labels of the CN group: metadata: name: mo namespace: mo-hn spec: + cnGroups: + - name: cn-set1 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"cn-set1\" + values: [\"1\", \"high\"] + - key: \"account\" + values: [\"acc1\"] + + - name: cn-set2 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"cn-set2\" + values: [\"2\", \"medium\"] + - key: \"account\" + values: [\"acc2\"] After the modifications, run the mo.yaml file using the command below: kubectl apply -f mo.yaml Run kubectl get pod -nmo-hn to check if the Proxy has adequately started: root@HOST-10-206-134-16:~# kubectl get pod -nmo-hn NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE mo-cn-set1-cn-0 1/1 Running 0 6s mo-cn-set2-cn-0 1/1 Running 0 6s mo-dn-0 1/1 Running 0 97m mo-log-0 1/1 Running 0 97m mo-log-1 1/1 Running 0 97m mo-log-2 1/1 Running 0 97m mo-proxy-69zjf 1/1 Running 0 97m mo-proxy-fpn2g 1/1 Running 0 97m The code example for a successful start is shown above. The label setting of CN groups is very flexible, but it is most commonly used for account and load isolation. For how to achieve account isolation and load isolation, continue to the following sections. Implementing account Isolation MatrixOne 0.7 version supports About MatrixOne Privilege Management data isolation. If account load isolation is to be implemented, it must be done by configuring Proxy and CN groups. Ordinary accounts In the label setting of CN groups, the account label is a reserved field used to match accounts. In this chapter, assuming that account load isolation needs to be implemented for acc1 and acc2 , you can refer to the detailed steps below: Note Only users with system account permissions can configure load isolation for ordinary accounts. Log into the MatrixOne cluster using the system account. For the username and password, please look at your company's Database Administrator . After logging into the MatrixOne cluster, create two new accounts, acc1 and acc2 : -- Create a new account acc1 with a password of 123456 (a simple password is set here, which is only used as an example) mysql > create account acc1 admin_name 'admin' identified by '123456' ; -- Create a new account acc2 with a password of 123456 (a simple password is set here, which is only used as an example) mysql > create account acc2 admin_name 'admin' identified by '123456' ; Modify the mo.yaml file of the MatrixOne cluster, and label the two CN groups with account:acc1 and account:acc2 respectively, corresponding to tenants named acc1 and acc2 respectively: metadata: name: mo namespace: mo-hn spec: + cnGroups: + - name: cn-set1 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"account\" + values: [\"acc1\"] + + - name: cn-set2 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"account\" + values: [\"acc2\"] Modify the mo.yaml file of the MatrixOne cluster, and label the two CN groups with account:acc1 and account:acc2 respectively, corresponding to the accounts named acc1 and acc2 respectively: -- acc1 account login MatrixOne root @ HOST - 10 - 206 - 134 - 7 : ~# mysql - h 10 . 96 . 1 . 153 - uacc1 : admin - P6001 - p123456 mysql : [ Warning ] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure .

ERROR 1045 (28000): internal error: no available CN server System account For system accounts, MatrixOne will automatically select an appropriate CN group to connect in the following order: Highest priority: Select the CN group configuring the account label as sys . Second highest priority: Select the CN group configuring other labels but not the account label. Medium priority: Select the CN group that has not configured labels. Low priority: If none of the above CN groups exist, then choose randomly from the existing CN groups. Based on this principle, system accounts will prioritize the CN groups specifically reserved for themselves or not for other accounts. However, suppose the above conditions are not met. In that case, the system account might share a CN group with other accounts and thus cannot ensure load isolation between the system account and ordinary accounts. Implementing Load Isolation The use case for the Proxy agent is load isolation. In many standard business environments, such as high-concurrency writes, report generation, backup, and significant data export, traditional database solutions often require the deployment of specific instances to achieve load isolation. This approach also results in an additional burden of data synchronization. MatrixOne uses a Proxy to implement resource group division, which can flexibly combine CN groups with user-specified load labels. In the event of load changes, MatrixOne can adjust the scale of the resource group through software configuration, thus better adapting to changes. Using the above example, you can set the load labels of two CNs to olap and oltp , respectively. Then, use SSB to simulate the OLTP load and TPCH to simulate the OLAP load. Note When performing performance testing, you must first scale out the entire cluster. metadata: name: mo namespace: mo-hn spec: + cnGroups: + - name: cn-set1 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"workload\" # The load label is set to olap + values: [\"olap\"] + + - name: cn-set2 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"workload\" # The load label is set to oltp + values: [\"oltp\"] Connection design for load isolation to be updated...","title":"Managing CN Groups with Proxy"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Deploy/mgmt-cn-group-using-proxy/#managing-cn-groups-with-proxy","text":"Proxy is a new system component introduced in MatrixOne's 0.8 version.

Note When performing performance testing, you must first scale out the entire cluster. metadata: name: mo namespace: mo-hn spec: + cnGroups: + - name: cn-set1 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"workload\" # The load label is set to olap + values: [\"olap\"] + + - name: cn-set2 + replicas: 1 + cnLabels: + - key: \"workload\" # The load label is set to oltp + values: [\"oltp\"] Connection design for load isolation to be updated...","title":"Implementing Load Isolation"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Deploy/update-MatrixOne-cluster/","text":"MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Upgrade This document will introduce how to Rolling upgrade or Reinstall upgrade MatrixOne clusters. The upgraded environment introduced in this document will be based on the environment of MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Deployment . Rolling upgrade Rolling upgrade is an online upgrade method; the MatrixOne cluster completes the software upgrade while ensuring that some or all services are available. According to the introduction in MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Deployment , the overall installation of MatrixOne is based on Kubernetes and MatrixOne Operator. Therefore, the rolling upgrade process is to realize automatic version updates by dynamically modifying the MatrixOne image version number in MatrixOne Operator. Steps Execute the following command on the terminal on the master0 node to enter the interface for dynamically modifying the yaml configuration file the operator uses. mo_ns=\"mo-hn\" #the namespace of matrixone cluster mo_cluster_name=\"mo\" # The cluster name of matrixone, generally mo, is specified according to the name in the YAML file of the matrixonecluster object during deployment or can be confirmed by kubectl get matrixonecluster -n${mo_ns} # mo-hn and mo have been set in the mo.yaml file of the installation and deployment kubectl edit matrixonecluster ${mo_cluster_name} -n${mo_ns} After entering edit mode, modify the value of spec.version ; the parameters are as below: ${TAG}: corresponds to the image tag of Matrixone on dockerhub, for example: nightly-f0d52530 ${REPO_URL}: public mirror repository for Matrixone, the default is matrixorigin/matrixone. If the target version does not exist in the public mirror warehouse of MatrixOne, you also need to modify the URL of the mirror warehouse to the existing warehouse: After completing the modification, press :wq to save. MatrixOne Operator will automatically pull the new version of the image and restart the component services, including Log Service, DN, and CN. You can also observe its running status through the following commands. watch -e \"kubectl get pod -n${mo_ns}\" NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE matrixone-operator-f8496ff5c-fp6zm 1/1 Running 0 24h mo-dn-0 1/1 Running 1 (51s ago) 18h mo-log-0 1/1 Running 0 18h mo-log-1 1/1 Running 1 (5s ago) 18h mo-log-2 1/1 Running 1 (53s ago) 18h mo-tp-cn-0 1/1 Running 1 (53s ago) 18h If an error, crashbackoff, etc., occurs, you can further troubleshoot the problem by viewing the component log. #pod_name is the name of the pod, such as mo-dn-0, mo-tp-cn-0 pod_name=mo-dn-0 kubectl logs ${pod_name} -nmo-hn > /tmp/dn.log vim /tmp/dn.log After the Restart of the components in the MatrixOne cluster is completed, you can use the MySQL Client to connect to the cluster.

Applicable scene : no need for old data The versions before and after the upgrade are not compatible with each other due to special reasons Note Before the operation, please ensure the data has been backed up (see modump backup tool) and the business knows that the database has stopped. Steps 1. Delete the old version cluster In master0, the old version cluster can be deleted in any of the following ways: # Method 1: Delete through the YAML file of the mo cluster during deployment, for example: kubectl delete -f /root/deploy/mo.yaml # Method 2: By deleting the matrixonecluster object, where mo is the name kubectl delete matrixonecluster.core.matrixorigin.io mo -nmo-hn Confirm that mo-related resources have been deleted by checking the pod status: kubectl get pod -nmo-hn In addition, if the PVC used by mo has not been deleted, use the following command to delete it manually: kubectl get pvc -nmo-hn # For example, the PVC used by the log service has not been deleted, delete it manually kubectl delete pvc mo-data-mo-log-0 -nmo-hn kubectl delete pvc mo-data-mo-log-1 -nmo-hn kubectl delete pvc mo-data-mo-log-2 -nmo-hn 2. Empty bucket data On the MinIO control page, delete the data in the bucket used by MinIO used by MO, including subdirectories such as mo-data, etc. Or operate through the MinIO client mc: mc rb --force minio/minio-mo/data/ mc rb --force minio/minio-mo/etl In addition, if you do not want to delete old data, you can create a new MinIO bucket and specify a unique bucket name in the YAML file for deploying the MatrixOne cluster. 3. Deploy the new version cluster Edit the yaml file that defines the MO cluster, refer to the Rolling Upgrade chapter, modify the .spec.version field to the latest version, and redeploy the MatrixOne cluster: vi mo.yaml # content omitted ... kubectl apply -f mo.yaml 4. Check if the upgrade is successful Please check if MatrixOne has started successfully with the following command. As shown in the following code example, when the Log Service, DN, and CN are all running normally, the MatrixOne cluster starts successfully. Connecting through the MySQL Client can also check if the database functions correctly.

In this mode, publishers and subscribers are loosely coupled, and no direct communication is required between them, thus improving the scalability and flexibility of the application. In databases, the publish-subscribe function is usually used in scenarios such as real-time data updates, cache synchronization, and business event notification. For example, when the data of a particular table in the database changes, the subscribers can be notified in real-time through the publish and subscribe function, to realize real-time data synchronization and processing. In addition, the notification of business events can also be recognized through the publish and subscribe function, such as an order being canceled, a certain inventory quantity is insufficient, and so on. There can be a many-to-many relationship between publishers and subscribers; one publisher can publish messages to multiple subscribers, and one subscriber can also subscribe to various messages/data. Usually, the publish-subscribe function of the database consists of two parts: Publisher and Subscriber . Publisher is responsible for publishing messages, while Subscriber subscribes to corresponding messages to achieve data synchronization. Application scenarios The publish-subscribe function has many typical application scenarios: Data Synchronization : When a database needs to be kept in sync with another database, the publish-subscribe feature can send data changes to the subscriber database. For example, when a website needs to transfer data from one geographic location to another, publish-subscribe functionality can ensure data synchronization between the two databases. Business data distribution : The publish and subscribe function can distribute business data to different systems or processes. For example, when a bank needs to distribute customer account information to multiple business systems, the publish-subscribe function can distribute data to corresponding systems to ensure data consistency between various business processes. Data backup : The publish-subscribe function can back up data. For example, when one database needs to be backed up to another database, the publish-subscribe part can be used to back up the data to the subscriber database so that the data can be recovered in the event of failure of the primary database. Real-time data processing : The publish-subscribe function can be used to realize real-time data processing. For example, when a website needs to process data from different users, the publish-subscribe part can be used to transmit data to a processing program for processing, to realize real-time data analysis and decision-making. Concepts Publication : In a database, a publication often refers to the process of setting a database object to be accessible by other accounts. It is a crucial step in data sharing and replication, where the published objects can be subscribed to by other accounts, and their data can be accessed. Subscription : A subscription refers to a database choosing to receive and replicate the data of a published database object. Publisher (Pub) : The Publisher is the database that performs the publishing operation. The Publisher is responsible for creating and managing the published objects, as well as managing the access permissions of databases subscribing to these published objects. Subscriber (Sub) : The Subscriber is the account that subscribes to the published objects. Published Object : A published object is a database created by the Publisher and made available for publication, namely a database. The data of these objects can be accessed and replicated by the Subscriber. Subscribed Object : A subscribed object is a published object replicated and stored on the Subscriber. The data of the subscribed object is updated according to the data on the Publisher. Publication/Subscription Scope Explanation Publish/Subscribe Application Scope Both Publisher and Subscriber are accounts of MatrixOne. Publishable/Subscribable Permissions Only ACCOUNTADMIN or MOADMIN role can create publications and subscriptions on the Publisher. Subscribers are controlled by ACCOUNTADMIN or MOADMIN roles to access subscription data permissions. Publication/Subscription Data Scope A single Publication can only be associated with one database. Publications and subscriptions are only implemented at the database level, with no current support for direct publication and subscription at the table level. The Subscriber only has read access to the Subscribed database . If the Publisher adjusts the sharing scope of the publication, those accounts that are no longer within the new scope and have already created a subscribed database will find that their access to the Subscribed database is invalid. If the Publisher attempts to delete a database that has been published, the deletion will fail. If the Publisher deletes a Publication , but the corresponding object still exists in the subscribed database, an error will be triggered when the Subscriber attempts to access this object. The Subscriber will need to delete the corresponding Subscription . If the Publisher deletes a Published object , but the corresponding object still exists in the subscribed database, an error will be triggered when the Subscriber attempts to access this object. The Subscriber must delete the corresponding Subscribed object .

SHOW SUBSCRIPTIONS","title":"Subscriber Reference"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Transactions/common-transaction-overview/","text":"General Transaction Overview Why do you need transactions? In many large, critical applications, computers perform many tasks every second. More often than not, these tasks are themselves, but these tasks are combined to complete a business requirement called a transaction. What happens if one task is executed successfully and an error occurs in a second or third related task? This error is likely to leave system data in an inconsistent state. At this time, the transaction becomes very important; it can make the system data out of this inconsistent state. How to understand transaction? For example, in the banking system, if there is no transaction to control and manage the data, A likely withdraws a sum of money from the corporate account, and B and C also withdraw money from the same corporate account. Each transfer involves at least two changes in account information (for example, A 's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; B 's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; C 's money comes, and the company's account goes out), If there are no transactions, then the exact value of the booking amount cannot be determined. After introducing the business requirement of the transaction, the essential characteristics of the transaction (ACID) ensure that the fund operation of the bank book is atomic (indivisible) and the amount seen by others is isolated. Each process is Consistent, and all operations are persistent, ensuring that the data in and out of the banking system remains consistent. What is Transaction? The transaction is a logical unit in the execution process of the database management system, consisting of a limited sequence of database operations. A transaction is a series of SQL statements submitted or rolled back as a logical unit. Characteristics of transactions Usually, transactions need to have four characteristics of ACID: Atomicity : The atomicity of a transaction means that a transaction is an indivisible unit, and the operations in a transaction either all or none of them occur. For example: start transaction; insert into t1 values(1,2,3),(4,5,6); update t2 set c1='b' where c1='B'; commit; Suppose an error occurs in inserting data into t1 or modifying any data in t2 . In that case, the entire transaction will be rolled back, and only when two statements succeed at the same time will the submission be successful, and one operation will not succeed while the other fails. Consistency : Transactional consistency means that data must remain correct and obey all data-related constraints before and after the transaction. For example, create a new table in database first: create table t1(a int primary key,b varchar(5) not null); To ensure data consistency here, when inserting data, to ensure the data type and range of columns a and b, the primary key constraint of column a and the non-null constraint of column b must be satisfied at the same time: insert into t1 values(1,'abcde'),(2,'bcdef'); Isolation : The isolation of a transaction is that when multiple users access concurrently, the specified isolation level must be observed between transactions. Within the determined isolation level range, one transaction cannot be interfered with by another transaction. For example, in the following transaction example, the session isolation level is read committed, and the data that can be seen in session 1 is as follows: select * from t1; +------+------+ | a | b | +------+------+ | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | +------+------+ At this point in session 2, you can do the following: begin; delete from t1 where a=3; In session 1, you can still see the data unchanged: select * from t1; +------+------+ | a | b | +------+------+ | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | +------+------+ Until the current transaction is committed in session 2: commit; The result of the committed transaction will only be seen in session 1: select * from t1; +------+------+ | a | b | +------+------+ | 1 | a | | 2 | b | +------+------+ Durability : Transaction durability means that when a transaction is committed in the database, its changes to the data are permanent, regardless of whether the database software is restarted. Transaction Types In a database, transactions are divided into the following categories: According to whether there is a clear start and end, it is divided into explicit transaction and implicit transaction . According to the use stage of the resource lock, it is divided into optimistic transaction and pessimistic transaction . These two types of transactions is not limited by each other. An explicit transaction can be an optimistic or pessimistic transaction, and a pessimistic transaction can be either an explicit or an implicit transaction. Explicit Transaction and Implicit Transaction Explicit transaction : In general, you can explicitly start a transaction by executing a BEGIN statement. A transaction can be ended explicitly by executing a COMMIT or ROLLBACK . MatrixOne's displayed transaction startup and execution methods are slightly different; see Explicit Transaction . Implicit transaction : The transaction can start and end implicitly, without using BEGIN TRANSACTION , COMMIT , or ROLLBACK statements to start and end. Implicit transactions behave in the same way as explicit transactions. However, the rules for determining when an implicit transaction begins differ from those for determining when an explicit transaction begins. MatrixOne's implicit transaction startup and execution methods are slightly different; see Implicit Transaction . Optimistic Transaction and Pessimistic Transaction Regardless of whether it is an optimistic or pessimistic transaction, the execution results of the transaction are the same; that is, the operations in a transaction have exactly the exact requirements for the ACID level, whether it is atomicity, consistency, isolation, or persistence, there is no situation where optimistic transactions are more relaxed and pessimistic transactions are stricter. The difference between an optimistic transaction and a pessimistic transaction is that it is just a two-phase commit based on a different execution strategy based on the state of the business to be processed. Its choice is based on the executor's judgment, and its efficiency is based on the actual state of the business being processed (the frequency of write conflicts of concurrent transactions). That is, different assumptions are made about the state of transaction-related resources so that write locks are placed in different stages. At the beginning of an optimistic transaction, it is assumed that the transaction-related tables are in a state where no write conflicts will occur. The insertion, modification, or deletion of data is cached in memory. At this stage, the data will not be locked, but in the data Lock the corresponding data table or data row when submitting, and unlock it after submitting. At the beginning of a pessimistic transaction, it is assumed that there will be written conflicts in the tables related to the transaction, and the related tables or rows are locked in advance. Then in memory, insert, modify or delete relevant data and commit. Data is only unlocked after a commit or rollback completes. Optimistic transactions and pessimistic transactions have the following advantages and disadvantages during use: Optimistic transactions are more friendly to systems with fewer write operations and more read operations, avoiding deadlocks. Optimistic transactions may fail after repeated retries due to conflicts when larger transactions are committed. Pessimistic transactions are more friendly to systems with more write operations and avoid write-write conflicts from the database level. Pessimistic transactions In a scenario with large concurrency, if a transaction with a long execution time appears, the system may be blocked, and the throughput will be affected. For more information on optimistic transactions in MatrixOne, see Optimistic Transaction . For more information on optimistic transactions in MatrixOne, see Pessimistic Transaction . Transaction Isolation One of the characteristics of transactions is isolation, which we usually call transaction isolation. Isolation is the most restrictive of the four ACID properties of database transactions. The database system usually uses a locking mechanism or a multi-version concurrency control mechanism to obtain a higher isolation level. Application software also requires additional logic to make it work properly. Many database management systems (DBMS) define different \"transaction isolation levels\" to control the degree of locking. In many database systems, most transactions avoid high-level isolation levels (such as serializability) to reduce locking overhead. Programmers must carefully analyze the database access part of the code to ensure that lowering the isolation level does not cause hard-to-find code bugs. On the contrary, a higher isolation level will increase the chance of deadlock, which must be avoided during programming. The DBMS is allowed to use a higher isolation level than the one requested because there are no operations in a higher isolation level that are prohibited by a lower isolation level. ANSI/ISO SQL defines four standard isolation levels: Isolation Level Dirty Write Dirty Read Fuzzy Read Phantom READ UNCOMMITTED Not Possible Possible Possible Possible READ COMMITTED Not Possible Not Possible Possible Possible REPEATABLE READ Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Possible SERIALIZABLE Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible READ UNCOMMITTED : READ UNCOMMITTED is the lowest isolation level. \"Dirty reads\" are allowed, and transactions can see the \"not committed\" modifications of other transactions. READ COMMITTED : At the READ COMMITTED level, the DBMS based on lock mechanism concurrency control needs to keep the write lock on the selected object until the end of the transaction, but the read lock is released immediately after the SELECT operation is completed. Like the previous isolation level, \"scope locks\" are not required. REPEATABLE READS : At the REPEATABLE READS isolation level, the DBMS based on the lock mechanism concurrency control needs to keep the read locks (read locks) and write locks (write locks) of the selected objects until the transaction end but does not require a \"range lock\", so a \"phantom read\" may occur. MatrixOne has implemented Snapshot Isolation and it is also known as REPEATABLE READS to maintain consistency with the isolation level in MySQL. SERIALIZABLE : SERIALIZABLE is the highest isolation level. On lock-based concurrency control DBMSs, serializability requires that read and write locks on selected objects be released at the end of the transaction.

More often than not, these tasks are themselves, but these tasks are combined to complete a business requirement called a transaction. What happens if one task is executed successfully and an error occurs in a second or third related task? This error is likely to leave system data in an inconsistent state. At this time, the transaction becomes very important; it can make the system data out of this inconsistent state. How to understand transaction? For example, in the banking system, if there is no transaction to control and manage the data, A likely withdraws a sum of money from the corporate account, and B and C also withdraw money from the same corporate account. Each transfer involves at least two changes in account information (for example, A 's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; B 's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; C 's money comes, and the company's account goes out), If there are no transactions, then the exact value of the booking amount cannot be determined. After introducing the business requirement of the transaction, the essential characteristics of the transaction (ACID) ensure that the fund operation of the bank book is atomic (indivisible) and the amount seen by others is isolated. Each process is Consistent, and all operations are persistent, ensuring that the data in and out of the banking system remains consistent.","title":"Why do you need transactions?"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Transactions/common-transaction-overview/#what-is-transaction","text":"The transaction is a logical unit in the execution process of the database management system, consisting of a limited sequence of database operations. A transaction is a series of SQL statements submitted or rolled back as a logical unit.","title":"What is Transaction?"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Transactions/common-transaction-overview/#characteristics-of-transactions","text":"Usually, transactions need to have four characteristics of ACID: Atomicity : The atomicity of a transaction means that a transaction is an indivisible unit, and the operations in a transaction either all or none of them occur. For example: start transaction; insert into t1 values(1,2,3),(4,5,6); update t2 set c1='b' where c1='B'; commit; Suppose an error occurs in inserting data into t1 or modifying any data in t2 . In that case, the entire transaction will be rolled back, and only when two statements succeed at the same time will the submission be successful, and one operation will not succeed while the other fails. Consistency : Transactional consistency means that data must remain correct and obey all data-related constraints before and after the transaction. For example, create a new table in database first: create table t1(a int primary key,b varchar(5) not null); To ensure data consistency here, when inserting data, to ensure the data type and range of columns a and b, the primary key constraint of column a and the non-null constraint of column b must be satisfied at the same time: insert into t1 values(1,'abcde'),(2,'bcdef'); Isolation : The isolation of a transaction is that when multiple users access concurrently, the specified isolation level must be observed between transactions. Within the determined isolation level range, one transaction cannot be interfered with by another transaction. For example, in the following transaction example, the session isolation level is read committed, and the data that can be seen in session 1 is as follows: select * from t1; +------+------+ | a | b | +------+------+ | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | +------+------+ At this point in session 2, you can do the following: begin; delete from t1 where a=3; In session 1, you can still see the data unchanged: select * from t1; +------+------+ | a | b | +------+------+ | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | +------+------+ Until the current transaction is committed in session 2: commit; The result of the committed transaction will only be seen in session 1: select * from t1; +------+------+ | a | b | +------+------+ | 1 | a | | 2 | b | +------+------+ Durability : Transaction durability means that when a transaction is committed in the database, its changes to the data are permanent, regardless of whether the database software is restarted.","title":"Characteristics of transactions"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Transactions/common-transaction-overview/#transaction-types","text":"In a database, transactions are divided into the following categories: According to whether there is a clear start and end, it is divided into explicit transaction and implicit transaction .

The difference between an optimistic transaction and a pessimistic transaction is that it is just a two-phase commit based on a different execution strategy based on the state of the business to be processed. Its choice is based on the executor's judgment, and its efficiency is based on the actual state of the business being processed (the frequency of write conflicts of concurrent transactions). That is, different assumptions are made about the state of transaction-related resources so that write locks are placed in different stages. At the beginning of an optimistic transaction, it is assumed that the transaction-related tables are in a state where no write conflicts will occur. The insertion, modification, or deletion of data is cached in memory. At this stage, the data will not be locked, but in the data Lock the corresponding data table or data row when submitting, and unlock it after submitting. At the beginning of a pessimistic transaction, it is assumed that there will be written conflicts in the tables related to the transaction, and the related tables or rows are locked in advance. Then in memory, insert, modify or delete relevant data and commit. Data is only unlocked after a commit or rollback completes. Optimistic transactions and pessimistic transactions have the following advantages and disadvantages during use: Optimistic transactions are more friendly to systems with fewer write operations and more read operations, avoiding deadlocks. Optimistic transactions may fail after repeated retries due to conflicts when larger transactions are committed. Pessimistic transactions are more friendly to systems with more write operations and avoid write-write conflicts from the database level. Pessimistic transactions In a scenario with large concurrency, if a transaction with a long execution time appears, the system may be blocked, and the throughput will be affected.

Isolation is the most restrictive of the four ACID properties of database transactions. The database system usually uses a locking mechanism or a multi-version concurrency control mechanism to obtain a higher isolation level. Application software also requires additional logic to make it work properly. Many database management systems (DBMS) define different \"transaction isolation levels\" to control the degree of locking. In many database systems, most transactions avoid high-level isolation levels (such as serializability) to reduce locking overhead. Programmers must carefully analyze the database access part of the code to ensure that lowering the isolation level does not cause hard-to-find code bugs. On the contrary, a higher isolation level will increase the chance of deadlock, which must be avoided during programming. The DBMS is allowed to use a higher isolation level than the one requested because there are no operations in a higher isolation level that are prohibited by a lower isolation level. ANSI/ISO SQL defines four standard isolation levels: Isolation Level Dirty Write Dirty Read Fuzzy Read Phantom READ UNCOMMITTED Not Possible Possible Possible Possible READ COMMITTED Not Possible Not Possible Possible Possible REPEATABLE READ Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Possible SERIALIZABLE Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible READ UNCOMMITTED : READ UNCOMMITTED is the lowest isolation level. \"Dirty reads\" are allowed, and transactions can see the \"not committed\" modifications of other transactions. READ COMMITTED : At the READ COMMITTED level, the DBMS based on lock mechanism concurrency control needs to keep the write lock on the selected object until the end of the transaction, but the read lock is released immediately after the SELECT operation is completed. Like the previous isolation level, \"scope locks\" are not required. REPEATABLE READS : At the REPEATABLE READS isolation level, the DBMS based on the lock mechanism concurrency control needs to keep the read locks (read locks) and write locks (write locks) of the selected objects until the transaction end but does not require a \"range lock\", so a \"phantom read\" may occur. MatrixOne has implemented Snapshot Isolation and it is also known as REPEATABLE READS to maintain consistency with the isolation level in MySQL. SERIALIZABLE : SERIALIZABLE is the highest isolation level. On lock-based concurrency control DBMSs, serializability requires that read and write locks on selected objects be released at the end of the transaction. Using a \"WHERE\" clause in a SELECT query to describe a range should acquire a \"range-locks\". Higher levels provide stronger isolation by requiring more restrictions than lower isolation levels.

If so, the updated timestamp is the latest. When operating on data, TAE caches the user data in memory. When committing a transaction, TAE writes the data in memory to the disk (the S3 path where the data is stored or the local disk path).

Create a Latch Free linked list based on the pointer field of the data tuple (Tuple, that is, each row in the table), called the version chain. This version chain allows the database to locate the desired version of a Tuple. Therefore, the storage mechanism of these versions of data is an essential consideration in the design of the database storage engine. One solution is the Append Only mechanism, where all tuple versions of a table are stored in the same storage space. This method is used in Postgre SQL. To update an existing Tuple, the database first fetches an empty slot from the table for the new version; then, it copies the current version's contents to the latest version. Finally, it applies the modifications to the Tuple in the newly allocated Slot. The critical decision of the Append Only mechanism is how to order the version chain of Tuple. Since it is impossible to maintain a lock-free doubly linked list, the version chain only points in one direction, either from Old to New (O2N) or New to Old (N2O). Another similar scheme is called Time Travel, which stores the information of the version chain separately, while the main table maintains the main version data. The third option is to maintain the main version of the tuple in the main table, and maintain a series of delta versions in a separate database comparison tool (delta) store. This storage is called a rollback segment in MySQL and Oracle. To update an existing tuple, the database fetches a contiguous space from the delta store to create a new delta version.

Create a Latch Free linked list based on the pointer field of the data tuple (Tuple, that is, each row in the table), called the version chain. This version chain allows the database to locate the desired version of a Tuple. Therefore, the storage mechanism of these versions of data is an essential consideration in the design of the database storage engine. One solution is the Append Only mechanism, where all tuple versions of a table are stored in the same storage space. This method is used in Postgre SQL. To update an existing Tuple, the database first fetches an empty slot from the table for the new version; then, it copies the current version's contents to the latest version. Finally, it applies the modifications to the Tuple in the newly allocated Slot. The critical decision of the Append Only mechanism is how to order the version chain of Tuple. Since it is impossible to maintain a lock-free doubly linked list, the version chain only points in one direction, either from Old to New (O2N) or New to Old (N2O). Another similar scheme is called Time Travel, which stores the information of the version chain separately, while the main table maintains the main version data. The third option is to maintain the main version of the tuple in the main table, and maintain a series of delta versions in a separate database comparison tool (delta) store. This storage is called a rollback segment in MySQL and Oracle. To update an existing tuple, the database fetches a contiguous space from the delta store to create a new delta version. This delta version contains the original value of the modified property, not the entire tuple. Then the database directly updates the main version in the main table (In Place Update).","title":"MVCC"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Transactions/matrixone-transaction-overview/optimistic-transaction/","text":"Optimistic Transactions in MatrixOne Optimistic Transaction principle When the transaction starts, no conflict detection or lock will be performed, and the relevant data will be cached in the corresponding memory area. The data will be added, deleted, or modified. After completing the modification, when entering the submission stage, it will be submitted in two steps: Step 1 : Use a column in the data to be written as the primary key column, lock the column and create a timestamp. Writes to related rows after this timestamp are judged as write conflicts. Step 2 : Write data, record the timestamp at this time, and unlock it. Optimistic Transaction model MatrixOne supports an optimistic transaction model. You don't lock a row while reading it using optimistic concurrency. When you want to update a row, the application must determine whether another user has updated the row since it was read. Optimistic concurrent transactions are typically used in environments with low data contention. In an optimistic concurrency model, an error occurs if you receive a value from the database and another user modifies it before you attempt to modify it. Example The following is an example of optimistic concurrency, showing how MatrixOne resolves concurrency conflicts. At 1:00 PM, User 1 reads a row from the database with the following value: CustID LastName FirstName 101 Smith Bob Column name Original value Current value Value in database CustID 101 101 101 LastName Smith Smith Smith FirstName Bob Bob Bob At 1:01 PM, User 2 reads the same row from the database.

Column name Original value Current value Value in database CustID 101 101 101 LastName Smith Smith Smith FirstName Bob James Robert At this point, user 1 encounters an optimistic concurrency violation because the value \"Robert\" in the database no longer matches the original value \"Bob\" that user 1 expected.

MatrixOne transactions follow the Standard Definition and Basic Characteristics (ACID) of database transactions. It aims to help users in a distributed database environment to ensure that every database data operation behavior can ensure the consistency and integrity of the results and isolate each other without interference under concurrent requests. Transaction type of MatrixOne In MatrixOne, transactions, like general transactions, are also divided into the following two categories: According to whether there is a clear start and end, it is divided into explicit and implicit transactions. Divided into optimistic and pessimistic transactions according to the use stage of resource locks. The classification of these two types of transactions is not limited by each other. An explicit transaction can be an optimistic or pessimistic transaction, and a pessimistic transaction can be either an explicit or an implicit transaction. Explicit Transaction In MatrixOne, a transaction explicitly declared with START TRANSACTION becomes explicit. Implicit Transaction In MatrixOne, if a transaction is not explicitly declared by START TRANSACTION or BEGIN , it is an implicit transaction. Optimistic Transaction At the beginning of an optimistic transaction, it is assumed that the transaction-related tables are in a state where no write conflicts will occur. The insertion, modification, or deletion of data is cached in memory. At this stage, the data will not be locked, but in the data Lock the corresponding data table or data row when submitting, and unlock it after submitting. Pessimistic Transaction MatrixOne defaults to pessimistic transactions. At the beginning of a pessimistic transaction, it is assumed that the transaction-related table is in a state where write conflicts may occur, and the corresponding data table or data row is locked in advance. After the locking action is completed, the data's insertion, modification, or deletion is cached in In memory; after committing or rolling back, the data is completed, and the lock is released. Transaction isolation level of MatrixOne MatrixOne supports two isolation levels: Read Committed and Snapshot Isolation . The default isolation level is Read Committed . Read Committed Read Committed is the default isolation level of MatrixOne after version 0.8, and it is also one of the four isolation levels in the SQL standard. Its most notable features are: Between different transactions, only the data submitted by other transactions can be read, and the uncommitted data cannot be viewed. The read-committed isolation level can effectively prevent dirty writes and dirty reads but cannot avoid non-repeatable reads and phantom reads. Isolation Level P0 Dirty Write P1 Dirty Read P4C Cursor Lost Update P4 Lost Update READ COMMITTED Not Possible Not Possible Possible Possible Snapshot Isolation Different from the four isolation levels defined by the SQL standard, in MatrixOne, the supported isolation level is snapshot isolation (Snapshot Isolation), which is isolated in the REPEATABLE READ and SERIALIZABLE of the SQL-92 standard between. Different from other isolation levels, snapshot isolation has the following characteristics: Snapshot isolation does not reflect changes made to data by other synchronized transactions for data read within a specified transaction. Specifies that the transaction uses the data rows read at the beginning of this transaction. Data is not locked while being read, so snapshot transactions do not prevent other transactions from writing data. Transactions that write data also do not block snapshot transactions from reading data. Compared with other isolation levels, snapshot isolation is also suitable for scenarios such as dirty reads (read uncommitted data), dirty writes (write uncommitted records after modification), phantom reads (multiple reads before and after, and the total amount of data is inconsistent) and other scenarios.

We provide a full building CRUD application tutorial with MyBatis and Spring Boot . Here, we'll focus on how to configure MyBatis with MatrixOne connection. The below example is a typical setting with Maven build system. 1. Add MyBatis-Spring-Boot-Starter in Pom.xml MyBatis applications are built on top of the Spring Boot. For that, you need to add this module to pom.xml which is created when you choose a Maven project. <dependency> <groupId>org.mybatis.spring.boot</groupId> <artifactId>mybatis-spring-boot-starter</artifactId> <version>2.1.4</version> </dependency> 2. Add Configuration You need to store some of the given parameters inside the application.properties . Five properties usually need to be modified: spring.datasource.driver-class-name : Driver name for MySQL connector. spring.datasource.url : JDBC connection URL with its parameters. spring.datasource.username : Database username. spring.datasource.password : Database password. mybatis.mapper-locations : Locations of Mapper XML config file. MatrixOne's recommended configuration is as below: spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:6001/test?characterSetResults=UTF-8&continueBatchOnError=false&useServerPrepStmts=true&alwaysSendSetIsolation=false&useLocalSessionState=true&zeroDateTimeBehavior=CONVERT_TO_NULL&failoverReadOnly=false&serverTimezone=Asia/Shanghai&socketTimeout=30000 spring.datasource.username=dump spring.datasource.password=111 mybatis.mapper-locations=classpath:mapping/*xml Note JDBC connection URL with recommended configuration is necessary, otherwise the connection will fail. Spring Data JPA Spring Data JPA is a robust framework that helps reduce boilerplate code and provides a mechanism for implementing basic CRUD operations via one of several predefined repository interfaces.

MatrixOne only supports org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect . spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto :This property takes an enum that controls the schema generation in a more controlled way. The possible options and effects are in the following table. MatrixOne only supports none and validate . Option Effect none No database Schema initialization create Drops and creates the schema at the application startup. With this option, all your data will be gone on each startup. create-drop Creates schema at the startup and destroys the schema on context closure. Useful for unit tests. validate Only checks if the Schema matches the Entities. If the schema doesn't match, then the application startup will fail. Makes no changes to the database. update Updates the schema only if necessary. For example, If a new field was added in an entity, then it will simply alter the table for a new column without destroying the data.

What is mo-dump Like mysqldump , MatrixOne has a client utility tool called mo-dump that can perform backups of a MatrixOne database by exporting a \".sql\" file type that contains SQL statements can be executed to recreate the original database. To use the mo-dump tool, you must have access to a server running an instance of MatrixOne. You must also have user credentials with the required privileges for the database you want to export. Syntax ./mo-dump -u ${user} -p ${password} -h ${host} -P ${port} -db ${database} [--local-infile=true] [-csv] [-tbl ${table}...] -net-buffer-length ${net-buffer-length} > {dumpfilename.sql} The parameters are as following: -u [user] : It is a username to connect to the MatrixOne server. Only the users with database and table read privileges can use mo-dump utility. Default value: dump -p [password] : The valid password of the MatrixOne user. Default value: 111 -h [host] : The host ip address of MatrixOne server. Default value: 127.0.0.1 -P [port] : The port of MatrixOne server. Default value: 6001 -db [database name] : Required parameter. Name of the database that you want to take backup. -net-buffer-length [packet size] : Packet size, the total size of the characters in the SQL statement. The data packet is the basic unit of SQL exported data. If no parameter is set, the default is 1048576 Byte (1M), and the maximum can be set to 16777216 Byte (16M). If the parameter here is set to 16777216 Byte (16M), then when the data larger than 16M is to be exported, the data will be split into multiple 16M data packets, except for the last data packet, the size of other data packets is 16M. -csv : The default value is false. The exported data is in CSV format when set to true. --local-infile : The default value is true and only takes effect when the parameter -csv is set to true. Indicates support for native export of CSV files. -tbl [table name] : Optional parameter. If the parameter is empty, the whole database will be exported. If you want to take the backup specific tables, then you can specify multiple -tbl and table names in the command. Build the mo-dump binary To use mo-dump utility, we need to build the tool first. mo-dump is embedded in the MatrixOne source code. You can build the binary from the source code. Tips: Same as MatrixOne mo-dump is written by Golang, building it will require a Golang installation and environment setting. Execute the following code to build the mo-dump binary from the MatrixOne source code: git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git cd matrixone make build modump Then you can find the mo-dump executable file in the MatrixOne folder. Note This built mo-dump file can also work in a same hardware platform. But a binary built in a x86 platform will not work correctly in a darwin ARM platform. The best practice is to build and use the binary file within the same operating system and hardware platform. mo-dump only supports Linux and macOS for now. Steps to Export your MatrixOne Database using mo-dump mo-dump is easy to use with the command line. Here are the steps to take to export a complete database in the form of SQL commands: Open up a command line or terminal window on your computer, then verify that from this terminal you can connect to your MatrixOne instance, enter this command to export the database: ./mo-dump -u username -p password -h host_ip_address -P port -db database > exporteddb.sql For example, if you are launching the terminal in the same server as the MatrixOne instance, and you want to generate the backup of the single database, run the following command. The command will generate the backup of the \" t \" database with structure and data in the t.sql file. The t.sql file will be located in the same directory as your mo-dump executable. ./mo-dump -u dump -p 111 -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -db t > t.sql If you want to export the tables in the database t to CSV format, refer to the following command: ./mo-dump -u dump -p 111 -db t -csv --local-infile=false > ttt.sql If you want to generate the backup of a single table in a database, run the following command. The command will generate the backup of the t1 table of t database with structure and data in the t.sql file. ./mo-dump -u dump -p 111 -db t -tbl t1 > t1.sql Constraints mo-dump only supports exporting the backup of a single database, if you have several databases to backup, you need to manually run mo-dump for several times. mo-dump doesn't support exporting only the structure or data of databases.

Using the Load data command in MySQL Client You can use Load Data to import data from big data files. This section will describe how to import a .csv file. Note : A csv (comma-separated values) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Steps The data file is in the same machine with the MatrixOne server Before executing Load Data in MatrixOne, the table needs to be created in advance. For now, the data file is required to be at the same machine with MatrixOne server, a file transfer is necessary if they are in separate machines. Launch the MySQL Client in the MatrixOne local server for accessing the local file system. mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -uroot -p111 Info The login account in the above code snippet is the initial account; please change the initial password after logging in to MatrixOne; see Password Management .

To work with local directory, you need to bind a local directory to the container. In the following example, the local file system path ~/tmp/docker_loaddata_demo/ is binded to the MatrixOne docker image, with a mapping to the /ssb-dbgen-path path inside the docker. We will walk you through the whole process of loading data with MatrixOne 0.8.0 docker version in this example. Download the dataset file and store the data in ~/tmp/docker_loaddata_demo/ : cd ~/tmp/docker_loaddata_demo/ wget https://community-shared-data-1308875761.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/lineorder_flat.tar.bz2 Unzip the dataset: tar -jxvf lineorder_flat.tar.bz2 Use Docker to launch MatrixOne, and mount the directory ~/tmp/docker_loaddata_demo/ that stores data files to a directory in the container. The container directory is /sb-dbgen-path as an example: sudo docker run --name matrixone --privileged -d -p 6001:6001 -v ~/tmp/docker_loaddata_demo/:/ssb-dbgen-path:rw matrixorigin/matrixone:0.8.0 Connect to MatrixOne server: mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -uroot -p111 Note: If your data file is on a different machine from the MatrixOne server, that is, the data file is on the client machine you are using, then you need to use the command line to connect to the MatrixOne service host: mysql -h <mo-host -ip> -P 6001 -udump -p111 --local-infile ; and the imported command line needs to use LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE syntax. Create lineorder_flat tables in MatrixOne, and import the dataset into MatriOne: mysql> create database if not exists ssb; mysql> use ssb; mysql> drop table if exists lineorder_flat; mysql> CREATE TABLE lineorder_flat( LO_ORDERKEY bigint key, LO_LINENUMBER int, LO_CUSTKEY int, LO_PARTKEY int, LO_SUPPKEY int, LO_ORDERDATE date, LO_ORDERPRIORITY char(15), LO_SHIPPRIORITY tinyint, LO_QUANTITY double, LO_EXTENDEDPRICE double, LO_ORDTOTALPRICE double, LO_DISCOUNT double, LO_REVENUE int unsigned, LO_SUPPLYCOST int unsigned, LO_TAX double, LO_COMMITDATE date, LO_SHIPMODE char(10), C_NAME varchar(25), C_ADDRESS varchar(25), C_CITY char(10), C_NATION char(15), C_REGION char(12), C_PHONE char(15), C_MKTSEGMENT char(10), S_NAME char(25), S_ADDRESS varchar(25), S_CITY char(10), S_NATION char(15), S_REGION char(12), S_PHONE char(15), P_NAME varchar(22), P_MFGR char(6), P_CATEGORY char(7), P_BRAND char(9), P_COLOR varchar(11), P_TYPE varchar(25), P_SIZE int, P_CONTAINER char(10) ); mysql> load data infile '/ssb-dbgen-path/lineorder_flat.tbl' into table lineorder_flat FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'; After the import is successful, you can run SQL statements to check the rows of imported data: select count(*) from lineorder_flat; /* expected results: */ +----------+ | count(*) | +----------+ | 10272594 | +----------+ Constraints The loaded csv file format supports JSON.

About JSONLines format JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular file format for about two decades, nowadays became de-facto of data exchange format standard, replacing XML, that was a huge buzzword in the early 2000's. If you are not familiar with JSON format, please help yourself to know about it with this official documentation . JSONLines text format, also called newline-delimited JSON, is a convenient format for storing structured data that may be processed one record at a time. Basically, JSONL is a file format that allows one JSON object per line with lines delimited by a newline character \\n . Each line of the file is independent, so commas are not required at the beginning or ending of lines. Nor does the entire contents of the file need to be enclosed in square or curly braces. JSONLines is appealing format for data streaming. Since every new line means a separate entry makes the JSON Lines formatted file streamable. It doesn't require custom parsers. Just read a line, parse as JSON, read a line, parse as JSON\u2026 and so on. The JSON Lines format has three requirements: UTF-8 Encoding: JSON allows encoding Unicode strings with only ASCII escape sequences, however those escapes will be hard to read when viewed in a text editor. The author of the JSON Lines file may choose to escape characters to work with plain ASCII files. Each Line is a Valid JSON Value: The most common values will be objects or arrays, but any JSON value is permitted. Line Separator is '\\n': This means '\\r\\n' is also supported because surrounding white space is implicitly ignored when parsing JSON values. Valid JSONLines format for MatrixOne JSONLines format only requires a valid JSON value for each line. But MatrixOne requires a more structured JSONLines format, only an JSON object or an JSON array with the same type of values and a plain structure are allowed in MatrixOne. If your JSONLines file has nested structures, MatrixOne doesn't support loading it for now. A valid object JSONLines example: {\"id\":1,\"father\":\"Mark\",\"mother\":\"Charlotte\"} {\"id\":2,\"father\":\"John\",\"mother\":\"Ann\"} {\"id\":3,\"father\":\"Bob\",\"mother\":\"Monika\"} Invalid object JSONLines example (with nested structure): {\"id\":1,\"father\":\"Mark\",\"mother\":\"Charlotte\",\"children\":[\"Tom\"]} {\"id\":2,\"father\":\"John\",\"mother\":\"Ann\",\"children\":[\"Jessika\",\"Antony\",\"Jack\"]} {\"id\":3,\"father\":\"Bob\",\"mother\":\"Monika\",\"children\":[\"Jerry\",\"Karol\"]} A valid array JSONLines example, it needs to look like a CSV format. [\"Name\", \"Session\", \"Score\", \"Completed\"] [\"Gilbert\", \"2013\", 24, true] [\"Alexa\", \"2013\", 29, true] [\"May\", \"2012B\", 14, false] [\"Deloise\", \"2012A\", 19, true] Invalid array JSONLines example (Data type and column numbers don't match): [\"Gilbert\", \"2013\", 24, true, 100] [\"Alexa\", \"2013\", \"twenty nine\", true] [\"May\", \"2012B\", 14, \"no\"] [\"Deloise\", \"2012A\", 19, true, 40] Syntax Scenario 1: The data file is in the same machine with the MatrixOne server. LOAD DATA INFILE {'filepath'='FILEPATH', 'compression'='COMPRESSION_FORMAT', 'format'='FILE_FORMAT', 'jsondata'='object'/'array'} INTO TABLE table_name [IGNORE x LINES/ROWS] [PARALLEL {'TRUE' | 'FALSE'}]; Scenario 2: The data file is in separate machines with the MatrixOne server. LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE {'filepath'='FILEPATH', 'compression'='COMPRESSION_FORMAT', 'format'='FILE_FORMAT', 'jsondata'='object'/'array'} INTO TABLE table_name [IGNORE x LINES/ROWS] [PARALLEL {'TRUE' | 'FALSE'}]; Parameter Description Parameter Value Required/Optional Description filepath String Required The file path. compression auto/none/bz2/gzip/lz4 Optional Compression algorithm format. format csv/jsonline Optional the loading file format. default is csv. jsondata object/array Optional jsonline format. If format is jsonline , must specify jsondata . table_name String Required table name to load into x Number Optional lines to be ignored while loading DDL guidelines for JSONLines format data Before load JSONLines data into MatrixOne, we need to firstly create a table. As JSON data type is not the same as MatrixOne data type, we need a guideline for DDL. JSON Type MatrixOne Type String VARCHAR (with a certain length limit) String TEXT (without knowing the limit of this string) String DATETIME or TIMESTAMP (with format as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.XXXXXX\") String DATE (with format as \"YYYY-MM-DD\") String TIME (with format as \"HH-MM-SS.XXXXXX\") Number INT (with interger numbers) Number FLOAT or DOUBLE (with floating numbers) Boolean BOOL(true/false) Object JSON type Array JSON type Null All types have been supported. For example, We can create a MatrixOne table with such a DDL for a JSONLines format file as below. mysql> create table t1 (name varchar(100), session varchar(100), score int, completed bool); [\"Name\", \"Session\", \"Score\", \"Completed\"] [\"Gilbert\", \"2013\", 24, true] [\"Alexa\", \"2013\", 29, true] [\"May\", \"2012B\", 14, false] [\"Deloise\", \"2012A\", 19, true] Some examples These are some full SQL examples to load a JSONLines file to MatrixOne. #Load a BZIP2 compressed jsonline object file load data infile {'filepath'='data.bzip2', 'compression'='bz2','format'='jsonline','jsondata'='object'} into table db.a #Load a plain jsonline array file load data infile {'filepath'='data.jl', 'format'='jsonline','jsondata'='array'} into table db.a #Load a gzip compressed jsonline array file and ignore the first line load data infile {'filepath'='data.jl.gz', 'compression'='gzip','format'='jsonline','jsondata'='array'} into table db.a ignore 1 lines; Tutorial In this tutorial, we will guide you through loading two jsonline files with object and array jsonformat.

If you are not familiar with JSON format, please help yourself to know about it with this official documentation . JSONLines text format, also called newline-delimited JSON, is a convenient format for storing structured data that may be processed one record at a time. Basically, JSONL is a file format that allows one JSON object per line with lines delimited by a newline character \\n . Each line of the file is independent, so commas are not required at the beginning or ending of lines. Nor does the entire contents of the file need to be enclosed in square or curly braces. JSONLines is appealing format for data streaming. Since every new line means a separate entry makes the JSON Lines formatted file streamable. It doesn't require custom parsers. Just read a line, parse as JSON, read a line, parse as JSON\u2026 and so on. The JSON Lines format has three requirements: UTF-8 Encoding: JSON allows encoding Unicode strings with only ASCII escape sequences, however those escapes will be hard to read when viewed in a text editor. The author of the JSON Lines file may choose to escape characters to work with plain ASCII files. Each Line is a Valid JSON Value: The most common values will be objects or arrays, but any JSON value is permitted. Line Separator is '\\n': This means '\\r\\n' is also supported because surrounding white space is implicitly ignored when parsing JSON values.","title":"About JSONLines format"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/import-data/bulk-load/load-jsonline/#valid-jsonlines-format-for-matrixone","text":"JSONLines format only requires a valid JSON value for each line.

You can also store almost any type and size of data with S3-compatible object storage, including data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. If you are unfamiliar with S3 object service, you may look up some basic introductions in AWS . AWS S3 has been remarkably successful for over a decade, so it became the de facto standard for object storage. Thus almost every mainstream public cloud vendors provide an S3-compatible object storage service. MatrixOne supports loading files from S3-compatible object storage services into databases. MatrixOne supports AWS and mainstream cloud vendors in China (Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud). In MatrixOne, there are two methods to import the data from S3-compatible object storage: Use Load data with an s3option to load the file into MatrixOne. This method will load the data into MatrixOne, and all next queries will happen inside MatrixOne. Create an external table with an s3option mapping to an S3 file, and query this external table directly. This method allows data access through an S3-compatible object storage service; each query's networking latency will be counted.

You can also store almost any type and size of data with S3-compatible object storage, including data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. If you are unfamiliar with S3 object service, you may look up some basic introductions in AWS . AWS S3 has been remarkably successful for over a decade, so it became the de facto standard for object storage. Thus almost every mainstream public cloud vendors provide an S3-compatible object storage service. MatrixOne supports loading files from S3-compatible object storage services into databases. MatrixOne supports AWS and mainstream cloud vendors in China (Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud). In MatrixOne, there are two methods to import the data from S3-compatible object storage: Use Load data with an s3option to load the file into MatrixOne. This method will load the data into MatrixOne, and all next queries will happen inside MatrixOne. Create an external table with an s3option mapping to an S3 file, and query this external table directly. This method allows data access through an S3-compatible object storage service; each query's networking latency will be counted.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/import-data/bulk-load/load-s3/#method-1-load-data","text":"","title":"Method 1: LOAD DATA"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/import-data/bulk-load/load-s3/#syntax","text":"LOAD DATA | URL s3options { \"endpoint\" = '<string>' , \"access_key_id\" = '<string>' , \"secret_access_key\" = '<string>' , \"bucket\" = '<string>' , \"filepath\" = '<string>' , \"region\" = '<string>' , \"compression\" = '<string>' } INTO TABLE tbl_name [ { FIELDS | COLUMNS } [ TERMINATED BY 'string' ] [[ OPTIONALLY ] ENCLOSED BY 'char' ] ] [ IGNORE number { LINES | ROWS } ] [ PARALLEL { 'TRUE' | 'FALSE' } ] Parameter Description Parameter Description endpoint A endpoint is a URL that can conncect to object storage service.

When executing this command, the client will read the specified SQL script file and execute all its SQL statements. Tutorial This tutorial will guide you on migrating data from MySQL to MatrixOne using the source command. Before you start Make sure you have already Deployed and Launched standalone MatrixOne . Steps 1. Dump MySQL data We suppose you have full access to your MySQL instances. Firstly, we use mysqldump to dump MySQL table structures and data to a single file with the following command. You can take a look at this wonderful tutorial if you are not familiar with mysqldump . The syntax is as below: mysqldump -h IP_ADDRESS -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD -d DB_NAME1 DB_NAME2 ... OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.SQL For example, this following command dumps all table structures and data of the database test to a single file named a.sql . mysqldump -h 127.0.0.1 -uroot -proot -d test > a.sql 2. Modify SQL file The SQL file dumped from MySQL is not fully compatible with MatrixOne yet. We'll need to remove and modify several elements to adapt the SQL file to MatrixOne's format. Unsupported syntax or features need to be removed: CHARACTER SET/CHARSET, COLLATE, ROW_FORMAT, USING BTREE, LOCK TABLE, SET SYSTEM_VARIABLE, ENGINE. Unsupported data type: If you use BINARY type, you can modify them to BLOB type. We take a typical mysqldump table as an example: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `tool`; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tool` ( `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `tool_id` bigint DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'id', `operation_type` varchar(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'type', `remark` varchar(100) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'remark', `create_user` varchar(20) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'create user', `create_time` datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'create time', PRIMARY KEY (`id`) USING BTREE, KEY `tool_id_IDX` (`tool_id`) USING BTREE, KEY `operation_type_IDX` (`operation_type`) USING BTREE ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1913 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC COMMENT='tool table'; To be able to successfully create this table in MatrixOne, it will be modifed as: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `tool`; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tool` ( `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `tool_id` bigint DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'id', `operation_type` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'type', `remark` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'remark', `create_user` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'create user', `create_time` datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'create time', PRIMARY KEY (`id`), KEY `tool_id_IDX` (`tool_id`), KEY `operation_type_IDX` (`operation_type`) ) COMMENT='tool table'; 3. Import into MatrixOne Once your dumped SQL file was ready, you can import the whole table structures and data into MatrixOne. Open a MySQL terminal and connect to MatrixOne.

Overview An subquery is a query within another SQL query. With subquery, the query result can be used in another query. In most cases, there are five types of subqueries: Scalar Subquery, such as SELECT (SELECT s1 FROM t2) FROM t1 . Derived Tables, such as SELECT t1.s1 FROM (SELECT s1 FROM t2) t1 . Existential Test, such as WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT ... FROM t2) , WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT ... FROM t2) . Quantified Comparison, such as WHERE t1.a = ANY(SELECT ... FROM t2) , WHERE t1.a = ANY(SELECT ... FROM t2) . Subquery as a comparison operator operand, such as WHERE t1.a > (SELECT ... FROM t2) . For more information on SQL statement, see SUBQUERY . In addition, from the execution of SQL statements, subquery generally has the following two types: Correlated Subquery: In Correlated Subquery nested in databases, the inner and outer queries would not be independent, and the inner queries would depend on the outer queries. The execution sequence is as follows: + Queries a record from the outer query. + Put the queried records into the inner query, then put the records that meet the conditions into the outer query. + Repeat the above steps For example: ``select * from tableA where tableA.cloumn &lt; (select column from tableB where tableA.id = tableB.id))`` Self-contained Subquery: In a database nested query, the inner query is entirely independent of the outer query. The execution sequence is as follows: + Execute the inner query first. + The result of the inner query is carried into the outer layer, and then the outer query is executed.

Overview A view acts as a virtual table, whose schema is defined by the SELECT statement that creates the view. Key Feature : Simplified user action : The view mechanism allows users to focus on the data they care about. If the data is not directly from the base table, you can define views to make the database look simple and simplify the user's data query operation. Multiple perspectives on the same data : The view mechanism enables different users to view the same data differently, which is necessary when many users share the same database. Provides a degree of logical independence for refactoring the database : Physical data independence means that the user's application does not depend on the physical structure of the database. The logical independence of the data indicates that when the database is restructured, such as adding new relationships or adding new fields to existing relationships, the user's application is not affected. Hierarchical databases and mesh databases can support the physical independence of data but can not fully support logical independence.

The secondary index does not directly store table data. Still, it indexes a part of the data (such as a column), allowing the database system to locate the table rows containing specific values quickly. Secondary indexes can help speed up query operations, especially when querying large tables. Secondary indexes can also support sorting, grouping, and join operations, which usually require sorting or matching a portion of the data in the table. Before you start Before reading this document, make sure that the following tasks are completed: Build a MatrixOne Cluster in MatrixOne. Read the Database Schema Design Overview . The database has been created. Use secondary index Create a secondary index. You can create a secondary index through the CREATE INDEX statement, specify the column for which the index is aimed, and other indexing options. The syntax structure is 'CREATE INDEX index_name on table_name (column_name); index_name is the name of the index, table_name is the name of the table on which the index is to be created, and column_name is the name of the column used to create the index. For example, if you want to create a secondary index on the last_name column of a table named employees , you can use the following SQL statement: CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON employees ( last_name ); Use a secondary index: You can use a secondary index in a query statement to locate data rows. The SQL query optimizer will automatically select the appropriate index to perform the query operation for the best performance. Such as: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith' ; In this example, the query optimizer will use the idx_lastname index to locate the data row whose last_name is smith . It should be noted that creating an index will increase the storage and maintenance costs of the database, and it may also affect performance when inserting, updating, and deleting data. Therefore, when creating a secondary index, it is necessary to carefully consider its impact on database performance and make the necessary optimizations and adjustments.

Such as: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith' ; In this example, the query optimizer will use the idx_lastname index to locate the data row whose last_name is smith . It should be noted that creating an index will increase the storage and maintenance costs of the database, and it may also affect performance when inserting, updating, and deleting data. Therefore, when creating a secondary index, it is necessary to carefully consider its impact on database performance and make the necessary optimizations and adjustments.","title":"Use secondary index"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/schema-design/create-secondary-index/#examples","text":"CREATE TABLE users ( id INT PRIMARY KEY , name VARCHAR ( 50 ), age INT , email VARCHAR ( 50 ) ); -- create a secondary index on the table to speed up the speed of querying users by name CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users ( name ); -- Insert data INSERT INTO users VALUES ( '1' , 'John' , '30' , 'john@gmail.com' ); INSERT INTO users VALUES ( '2' , 'Tommy' , '50' , 'tom@gmail.com' ); INSERT INTO users VALUES ( '3' , 'Ann' , '33' , 'ann@gmail.com' ); -- Perform the following query, the database can use the secondary index to quickly find all users with the name 'John' without having to scan the entire table mysql > SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John' ; + ------+------+------+----------------+ | id | name | age | email | + ------+------+------+----------------+ | 1 | John | 30 | john @ gmail . com | + ------+------+------+----------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec )","title":"Examples"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/schema-design/create-table/","text":"Create a Table This document introduces how to create tables using the SQL statement and the related best practices. In the previous document, you created a database named modatabase . In this document, you will create a table in the database. Before you start Before reading this document, make sure that the following tasks are completed: Build a MatrixOne Cluster in MatrixOne. Read the Database Schema Design Overview . The database has been created. What is a table A table is a logical object in MatrixOne cluster that is subordinate to the database. It is used to store the data. Tables save data records in the form of rows and columns. A table has at least one column. If you have defined n columns, each row of data has exactly the same fields as the n columns. Name a table The first step for creating a table is to give your table a name. Do not use meaningless names that will cause great distress to yourself or your colleagues in the future. It is recommended that you follow your company or organization's table naming convention. The CREATE TABLE statement usually takes the following form: CREATE TABLE { table_name } ( { elements } ); For more information on CREATE TABLE statement, see CREATE TABLE . Parameter description {table_name}: The name of the table to be created. {elements}: A comma-separated list of table elements, such as column definitions and primary key definitions. Define columns A column is subordinate to a table. Each table has at least one column. Columns provide a structure to a table by dividing the values in each row into small cells of a single data type. Column definitions typically take the following form. {column_name} {data_type} {column_qualification} Parameter description {column_name}: The column name. {data_type}: The column data type. {column_qualification}: Column qualifications. Suppose you need to create a table to store the NATION information in the modatabase database. CREATE TABLE NATION ( N_NATIONKEY INTEGER NOT NULL , N_NAME CHAR ( 25 ) NOT NULL , N_REGIONKEY INTEGER NOT NULL , N_COMMENT VARCHAR ( 152 ), ); Explanations The following table explains the fields in the above example: Field name Data type Function Explanation N_NATIONKEY INTEGER The unique identifier of the nation All identifiers should be of type INTEGER N_NAME CHAR Ethnic name Ethnic name is char type, and no more than 25 characters N_REGIONKEY INTEGER Region code, unique identifier All identifiers should be of type INTEGER N_COMMENT VARCHAR comment information varchar type, and no more than 152 characters MatrixOne supports many other column data types, including the integer types, floating-point types, date and time types. For more information, see Data Types . Create a complex table Create a new table named ORDERS . CREATE TABLE ORDERS ( O_ORDERKEY BIGINT NOT NULL , O_CUSTKEY INTEGER NOT NULL , O_ORDERSTATUS CHAR ( 1 ) NOT NULL , O_TOTALPRICE DECIMAL ( 15 , 2 ) NOT NULL , O_ORDERDATE DATE NOT NULL , O_ORDERPRIORITY CHAR ( 15 ) NOT NULL , O_CLERK CHAR ( 15 ) NOT NULL , O_SHIPPRIORITY INTEGER NOT NULL , O_COMMENT VARCHAR ( 79 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( O_ORDERKEY ) ); This table contains more data types than the NATION table: Field name Data type Function Explanation O_TOTALPRICE DECIMAL O_TOTALPRICE is used to mark the price The precision is 15, and the scale is 2; that is, the accuracy represents the total number of digits in the field value, and the scale means how many digits there are after the decimal point, for example decimal(5,2), that is, the precision is 5 when the ratio is 2, its value ranges from -999.99 to 999.99. decimal(6,1), when the accuracy is 6, and the scale is 1, its value range is from -99999.9 to 99999.9. O_ORDERDATE DATE Date value Date of the order Select primary key A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values uniquely identify a row in the table. The primary key is defined in the CREATE TABLE statement. The primary key constraint requires that all constrained columns contain only non-NULL values. A table can be created without a primary key or with a non-integer primary key. Set default value To set a default value on a column, use the DEFAULT constraint. The default value allows you to insert data without specifying a value for each column. You can use DEFAULT together with supported SQL functions to move the calculation of defaults out of the application layer, thus saving resources of the application layer. The resources consumed by the calculation do not disappear and are moved to the MatrixOne cluster. The following exemplifies setting the default value in the t1 table: create table t1 ( a int default ( 1 ), b int ); insert into t1 ( b ) values ( 1 ), ( 1 ); > select * from t1 ; + ------+------+ | a | b | + ------+------+ | 1 | 1 | | 1 | 1 | + ------+------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) The default value of a is 1. You can also set the default value to the time when the value was inserted; see the simple example below: -- Create the table and set the default value to the current time CREATE TABLE t2 ( id INT PRIMARY KEY , name VARCHAR ( 50 ), created_at DATETIME DEFAULT NOW () ); INSERT INTO t2 ( id , name ) VALUES ( 1 , 'John' ), ( 2 , 'Jane' ), ( 3 , 'Mike' ); > SELECT * FROM t2 ; + ------+------+---------------------+ | id | name | created_at | + ------+------+---------------------+ | 1 | John | 2023 - 07 - 10 11 : 57 : 27 | | 2 | Jane | 2023 - 07 - 10 11 : 57 : 27 | | 3 | Mike | 2023 - 07 - 10 11 : 57 : 27 | + ------+------+---------------------+ 3 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) After executing the above insert statement, each row's created_at column will be automatically set to the current time. Prevent duplicate values If you need to prevent duplicate values in a column, you can use the UNIQUE constraint. For example, to make sure that N_NATIONKEY are unique, you can rewrite the table creation SQL statement for the NATION table like this: CREATE TABLE NATION ( N_NATIONKEY INTEGER NOT NULL , N_NAME CHAR ( 25 ) NOT NULL , N_REGIONKEY INTEGER NOT NULL , N_COMMENT VARCHAR ( 152 ), UNIQUE KEY ( N_NATIONKEY ) ); If you try to insert the same value of N_NATIONKEY in the NATION table, an error is returned. Prevent null values If you need to prevent null values in a column, you can use the NOT NULL constraint. Use the nation's name as an example. In addition to the unique value of the national, it is also hoped that the name of the nation cannot be empty, so here you can write the creation SQL of the NATION table as follows: CREATE TABLE NATION ( N_NATIONKEY INTEGER NOT NULL , N_NAME CHAR ( 25 ) NOT NULL , N_REGIONKEY INTEGER NOT NULL , N_COMMENT VARCHAR ( 152 ), PRIMARY KEY ( N_NATIONKEY ) ); Execute the SHOW TABLES statement To view all tables under the modatabase database, use the SHOW TABLES statement. SHOW TABLES IN ` modatabase ` ; Running results: +----------------------+ | tables_in_modatabase | +----------------------+ | nation | | orders | +----------------------+ Guidelines to follow when creating a table This section provides guidelines you need to follow when creating a table. Guidelines to follow when naming a table Use a fully-qualified table name (for example, CREATE TABLE {database_name}. {table_name} ). If you do not specify the database name, MatrixOne uses the current database in your SQL session. If you do not use USE {databasename}; to specify the database in your SQL session, MatrixOne returns an error. Use meaningful table names. For example, if you need to create a NATION table, you can use names: NATION , t_user , users , or follow your company or organization's naming convention. Multiple words are separated by an underscore, and it is recommended that the name is no more than 32 characters. Create a separate DATABASE for tables of different business modules and add comments accordingly. Guidelines to follow when defining columns Check the data types supported. Check the guidelines to follow for selecting primary keys and decide whether to use primary key columns. Check adding column constraints and decide whether to add constraints to the columns. Use meaningful column names. It is recommended that you follow your company or organization's table naming convention. If your company or organization does not have a corresponding naming convention, refer to the column naming convention. Guidelines to follow when selecting primary key Define a primary key or unique index within the table. Try to select meaningful columns as primary keys. For performance reasons, try to avoid storing extra-wide tables. It is not recommended that the number of table fields is over 60 and that the total data size of a single row is over 64K. It is recommended to split fields with too much data length to another table. It is not recommended to use complex data types. For the fields to be joined, ensure that the data types are consistent and avoid implicit conversion. Avoid defining primary keys on a single monotonic data column. If you use a single monotonic data column (for example, a column with the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute) to define the primary key, it might impact the write performance.","title":"Create Table"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/schema-design/create-table/#create-a-table","text":"This document introduces how to create tables using the SQL statement and the related best practices.

You can use temporary tables to hold some intermediate results in a session; for example, you may need to query these results multiple times, or these results are a subset of other queries. Advantages of temporary tables Temporary tables have several uses and advantages in database design: Data Isolation : Temporary tables are independent in each session or transaction. This means that two temporary tables with the same name can exist in two different sessions without affecting each other. Simplify complex queries : If a query is very complex and involves multiple joins and subqueries, you can save the query results to a temporary table and then perform operations on this temporary table, thereby simplifying the query and improving performance. Improve performance : Saving data in temporary tables can significantly improve query performance for complex queries with large data sets. The access speed is fast because the temporary table is stored in memory. Protect data : Use temporary tables to avoid modification of original data. When you need to perform operations that may change the original data, you can store the data in a temporary table and then perform functions on the temporary table to avoid changing the original data by mistake. Save storage space : Temporary tables are automatically deleted when no longer needed, saving storage space. Helpful for debugging : In complex nested queries, temporary tables can store intermediate results to help debug and verify the output of each step.

How to use temporary tables The syntax for using a temporary table is the same as for a regular table, except that the TEMPORARY keyword is added before the statement that creates the table: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_name ( column_list ); You can use the same table name for temporary and regular tables without conflicts because they are in different namespaces. However, two temporary tables cannot share the same name in the session. Note Even though temporary tables can have the same name as permanent tables, it is not recommended as this may result in unexpected data loss. For example, if the connection to the database server is lost and you automatically reconnect to the server, you cannot distinguish between temporary and permanent tables. Then, you issue a DROP TABLE statement. This time, the permanent table may be deleted instead of the temporary table. This result is unpredictable. When you use the 'SHOW TABLES' command to display a list of data tables, you cannot see a list of temporary tables either.

Unlike ordinary tables (tables that store data), views do not contain data but are only formatted displays of query results based on the base table (the table being queried). You can think of a view as a window on a table; the data in this window is reflected on other tables. When a view is queried, the database applies its SQL query to its underlying tables. Advantages of Views Simplify queries: For complex queries, you can create views to hide the complexity of the query, and you only need to select data from the view without remembering complex query statements. Add an extra layer of security: Views can restrict user's access to specific database fields and only display the fields they need to see, which can protect the security of the data. Maintain data consistency: Creating a view can maintain data consistency if multiple queries need to use the same query clause. Logical abstraction: Views can represent functional parts of base table data, summaries, and information from several tables. But Views also have disadvantages: Performance: Querying data from a database view can be slow, especially if the view is created based on other views. Depends on other tables: A view will be created based on the underlying tables of the database. Not all views support updating data, depending on the definition of the view and its underlying tables.

Unlike ordinary tables (tables that store data), views do not contain data but are only formatted displays of query results based on the base table (the table being queried). You can think of a view as a window on a table; the data in this window is reflected on other tables. When a view is queried, the database applies its SQL query to its underlying tables.","title":"What is View"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/schema-design/create-view/#advantages-of-views","text":"Simplify queries: For complex queries, you can create views to hide the complexity of the query, and you only need to select data from the view without remembering complex query statements. Add an extra layer of security: Views can restrict user's access to specific database fields and only display the fields they need to see, which can protect the security of the data. Maintain data consistency: Creating a view can maintain data consistency if multiple queries need to use the same query clause. Logical abstraction: Views can represent functional parts of base table data, summaries, and information from several tables. But Views also have disadvantages: Performance: Querying data from a database view can be slow, especially if the view is created based on other views. Depends on other tables: A view will be created based on the underlying tables of the database. Not all views support updating data, depending on the definition of the view and its underlying tables.","title":"Advantages of Views"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/schema-design/create-view/#before-you-start","text":"Before reading this document, make sure that the following tasks are completed: Build a MatrixOne Cluster in MatrixOne.

This document introduces terminology related to MatrixOne databases and subsequent data read and write examples. Key concept in MatrixOne Database Schema: The database schema mentioned in this article is the same as the logical object database. It is the same as MySQL. Database A database in MatrixOne is a collection of objects such as tables. To view the default database contained by MatrixOne, ues SHOW DATABASES; statment. To create a new database, ues CREATE DATABASE database_name; statement. Table A table is a collection of related data in a database. Each table consists of rows and columns. Each value in a row belongs to a specific column. Each column allows only a single data type. To further qualify columns, you can add some constraints. Index An index is a data structure used to find data in database tables quickly. It can be seen as a 'table of contents' that contains pointers to the data of each row in the table, making it possible for queries to locate data that meets specific conditions more quickly. The indexes commonly used in databases include primary key indexes, secondary indexes, etc. Among them, unique indexes are used to ensure the uniqueness of specific columns or combinations of columns, ordinary indexes are used to improve query performance, and full-text indexes are used for full-text search in text data. There are two common types of indexes, namely: Primary Key : Primary key index, that is, the index that identifies the primary key column. The primary key index uniquely identifies each row of data in the table. Secondary index : Secondary index is the index identified on the non-primary key. The secondary index, also called a non-clustered index, is used to improve query performance and speed up data retrieval. Other supported logical objects MatrixOne supports the following logical objects at the same level as table: View: a view acts as a virtual table, whose schema is defined by the SELECT statement that creates the view. Temporary table: a table whose data is not persistent. Access Control MatrixOne supports both user-based and role-based access control. To allow users to view, modify, or delete data, for more information, see Access control in MatrixOne .

Rules When defining FOREIGN KEY, the following rules need to be followed: The parent table must already exist in the database or be a table currently being created. In the latter case, the parent table and the slave table are the same table, such a table is called a self-referential table, and this structure is called self-referential integrity. A primary key must be defined for the parent table. Primary keys cannot contain null values, but null values are allowed in foreign keys. In other words, as long as every non-null value in the foreign key appears in the specified primary key, the content of the foreign key is correct. Specify the column name or combination of column names after the table name of the parent table. This column or combination of columns must be the primary or candidate key of the primary table. The number of columns in the foreign key must be the same as the number of columns in the primary key of the parent table. The data type of the column in the foreign key must be the same as the data type of the corresponding column in the primary key of the parent table. The foreign key's value must be consistent with the primary key's value in the main table. Foreign Key Characteristics Multi-column foreign key: This type of foreign key is when two or more columns in a table jointly reference another table's primary key. In other words, these columns together define the reference to another table. They must exist in the form of a group and need to meet the foreign key constraint simultaneously. Multi-level foreign key: This situation usually involves three or more tables, and they have a dependency relationship. A table's foreign key can be another table's primary key, and this table's foreign key can be the primary key of a third table, forming a multi-level foreign key situation. Syntax Foreign keys are defined in the child table, and the primary foreign key constraint syntax is as follows: > column_name data_type FOREIGN KEY; > CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype [NOT NULL], column2 datatype [NOT NULL], ... FOREIGN KEY (column1, column2, ... column_n) REFERENCES parent_table (column1, column2, ... column_n) ); Explanation FOREIGN KEY (column1, column2, ... column_n) : Defines the columns to be used as the foreign key. REFERENCES parent_table (column1, column2, ... column_n) : REFERENCES defines the parent table being referenced and the columns in the parent table. Examples Example 1 -- Create a table named t1, containing two columns: a and b. The column a is of type int and is set as the primary key, while the column b is of type varchar with a length of 5. create table t1 ( a int primary key , b varchar ( 5 )); -- Create a table named t2, containing three columns: a, b, and c. The column a is of type int, the column b is of type varchar with a length of 5. The column c is of type int, and is set as a foreign key, establishing a relationship with the column a in table t1. create table t2 ( a int , b varchar ( 5 ), c int , foreign key ( c ) references t1 ( a )); -- Insert two rows of data into table t1: (101, 'abc') and (102, 'def'). mysql > insert into t1 values ( 101 , 'abc' ),( 102 , 'def' ); Query OK , 2 rows affected ( 0 . 01 sec ) -- Insert two rows of data into table t2: (1, 'zs1', 101) and (2, 'zs2', 102), where 101 and 102 are the primary keys in table t1. mysql > insert into t2 values ( 1 , 'zs1' , 101 ),( 2 , 'zs2' , 102 ); Query OK , 2 rows affected ( 0 . 01 sec ) -- Insert a row of data into table t2: (3, 'xyz', null), where null means that this row of data has no associated primary key in column c (the foreign key column). mysql > insert into t2 values ( 3 , 'xyz' , null ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 01 sec ) -- Attempt to insert a row of data into table t2: (3, 'xxa', 103). However, 103 does not exist in the primary keys of table t1, so the insertion fails due to violation of the foreign key constraint. mysql > insert into t2 values ( 3 , 'xxa' , 103 ); ERROR 20101 ( HY000 ): internal error : Cannot add or update a child row : a foreign key constraint fails Example Explanation : In the above example, column c of t2 can only refer to the value or null value of column a in t1, so the operation of inserting row 1 and row 2 of t1 can be successfully inserted, but row 3 103 in the row is not a value in column a of t1, which violates the foreign key constraint, so the insert fails. Example 2 - Multi-column foreign key -- Creating a \"Student\" table to store student information CREATE TABLE Student ( StudentID INT , -- Student ID field, integer Name VARCHAR ( 100 ), -- Student name field, string with a maximum length of 100 PRIMARY KEY ( StudentID ) -- Setting the StudentID as the primary key of this table ); -- Creating a \"Course\" table to store course information CREATE TABLE Course ( CourseID INT , -- Course ID field, integer CourseName VARCHAR ( 100 ), -- Course name field, string with a maximum length of 100 PRIMARY KEY ( CourseID ) -- Setting the CourseID as the primary key of this table ); -- Creating a \"StudentCourse\" table to store student course selection information CREATE TABLE StudentCourse ( StudentID INT , -- Student ID field, integer, corresponds to the StudentID field in the Student table.

In this case, the Student ID and Course ID in the course selection table can serve as foreign keys, jointly referencing the primary keys of the student table and the course table. Example 3 - Multi-level foreign key -- Creating a \"Country\" table to store country information CREATE TABLE Country ( CountryID INT , -- Country ID field, integer CountryName VARCHAR ( 100 ), -- Country name field, string with a maximum length of 100 PRIMARY KEY ( CountryID ) -- Setting the CountryID as the primary key of this table ); -- Creating a \"State\" table to store state/province information CREATE TABLE State ( StateID INT , -- State/province ID field, integer StateName VARCHAR ( 100 ), -- State/province name field, string with a maximum length of 100 CountryID INT , -- Country ID field, integer, corresponds to the CountryID field in the Country table.

The State table has a field, CountryID , which is the primary key of the Country table and is also the foreign key of the State table. The City table has a field, StateID , which is the State table's primary key and the City table's foreign key.

These restrictions are called constraints. For example, if the execution result of a DML statement violates the integrity constraint, the statement will be rolled back, and an error message will be returned. Integrity Constraints Types There are various constraints in MatrixOne, and different constraints have different restrictions on database behavior. Currently, supported constraints are table-level constraints: NOT NULL integrity constraints : The non-null constraint means that the data in a specific column cannot have a null value (NULL), and the data that violates the constraint cannot be inserted or updated in the corresponding column. In MatrixOne, a table can have zero, one, or more not-null constraints. UNIQUE KEY integrity constraints The unique key constraint means that in a specific column or a combination of multiple columns stored in a table, the value of this column (or column set) in the inserted or updated data row is unique. In MatrixOne, zero, one, or more unique key constraints are allowed in a table, but unlike other relational databases, the unique key constraints of MatrixOne must also be non-empty. PRIMARY KEY integrity constraints The primary key constraint means that in a specific column or a combination of multiple columns stored in a table, each data row can be uniquely determined by a specific key value and is not empty. There can only be, at most, one primary key constraint in a table. FOREIGN KEY integrity constraints A foreign key constraint means that a column or columns in another table reference a column or a combination of columns stored in one table. The referenced table is usually called the parent table, and the referenced table is called the child table. The child table refers to the data of the corresponding column of the parent table, which can only be the data or null value of the parent table. This kind of constraint is called a foreign key constraint.","title":"Data Integrity Constraints Overview"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/schema-design/data-integrity/overview-of-integrity-constraint-types/#data-integrity-constraints-overview","text":"In MatrixOne, to ensure the data's correctness, integrity, and validity, restrictions are added to specific columns in the table creation statement to ensure that the information stored in the database complies with specific rules.

Currently, supported constraints are table-level constraints: NOT NULL integrity constraints : The non-null constraint means that the data in a specific column cannot have a null value (NULL), and the data that violates the constraint cannot be inserted or updated in the corresponding column. In MatrixOne, a table can have zero, one, or more not-null constraints. UNIQUE KEY integrity constraints The unique key constraint means that in a specific column or a combination of multiple columns stored in a table, the value of this column (or column set) in the inserted or updated data row is unique. In MatrixOne, zero, one, or more unique key constraints are allowed in a table, but unlike other relational databases, the unique key constraints of MatrixOne must also be non-empty.

MatrixOne supports the following operating system: Linux OS Version Debian 11.0 or later Ubuntu LTS 20.04 or later Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 or later releases Oracle Enterprise Linux 9.0 or later releases MatrixOne also supports macOS operating system, but it's only recommended to run as a test and development environment. macOS Version macOS Monterey 12.3 or later Hardware requirements What are the required hardware for deploying MatrixOne? For standalone installation, MatrixOne can be running on the 64-bit generic hardware server platform in the Intel x86-64 and ARM architecture. The requirements and recommendations about server hardware configuration for development, testing and production environments are as follows: Development and testing environments CPU Memory Local Storage 4 core+ 16 GB+ SSD/HDD 200 GB+ The Macbook M1/M2 with ARM architecture is also a good fit for a development environment. Production environment CPU Memory Local Storage 16 core+ 64 GB+ SSD/HDD 500 GB+ For comprehensive details on deploying MatrixOne in a distributed setting, see Distributed Deployment Topology Documentation . This guide includes specific server hardware configuration requirements and recommendations tailored for development, testing, and production environments. Installation and deployment What settings do I need to change for installation? Normally you don't need to change anything for installation. A default setting of launch.toml is enough to run MatrixOne directly. But if you want to customize your listening port, ip address, stored data files path, you may modify the corresponding records of cn.toml , dn.toml or log.toml , for more details about parameter configuration in these files, see Boot Parameters for standalone installation . After the MySQL client is installed, I open the terminal and run mysql , I got an error of command not found: mysql . To solve the error, you need to set the environment variable. Open a new terminal window, run the following command: Linux Environment MacOS Environment cd ~ sudo vim /etc/profile Password: After pressing Enter on the keyboard to execute the above command, you need to enter the root user password, which is the root password you set in the installation window when you installed the MySQL client. If no password has been set, press Enter to skip the password. After entering/skiping the root password, you will enter profile , click i on the keyboard to enter the insert state, and you can enter the following command at the bottom of the file: export PATH=/software/mysql/bin:$PATH Click esc on the keyboard to exit the insert status and type :wq at the bottom to save and exit. Continue typing source /etc/profile and press Enter to run the environment variable. cd ~ sudo vim .bash_profile Password: After pressing Enter on the keyboard to execute the above command, you need to enter the root user password, which is the root password you set in the installation window when you installed the MySQL client. If no password has been set, press Enter to skip the password. After entering/skiping the root password, you will enter .bash_profile , click i on the keyboard to enter the insert state, and you can enter the following command at the bottom of the file: export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin Click esc on the keyboard to exit the insert status and type :wq at the bottom to save and exit. Continue typing source. bash_profile and press Enter to run the environment variable. When I install MatrixOne by building from source, I got an error of the following and the build failed, how can I proceed? Error: Get \"https://proxy.golang.org/........\": dial tcp 142.251.43.17:443: i/o timeout As MatrixOne needs many go libraries as dependency, it downloads them at the time of building it. This is an error of downloading timeout, it's mostly a networking issue. If you are using a Chinese mainland network, you need to set your go environment to a Chinese image site to accelerate the go library downloading. If you check your go environment by go env , you may see GOPROXY=\"https://proxy.golang.org,direct\" , you need to set it by go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct Then the make build should be fast enough to finish. When I want to save the MatrixOne data directory to my specified file directory, how should I do it? When you use Docker to start MatrixOne, you can mount the data directory you specify to the Docker container, see Mount directory to Docker container . When you use the source code or binary package to compile and start MatrixOne, you can modify the default data directory path in the configuration file: open the MatrixOne source file directory matrixone/etc/launch-tae-CN-tae-DN , modify the configuration parameter data-dir = \"./mo-data\" in the three files of cn.toml , dn.toml and log.toml is data-dir = \"your_local_path\" , save and restart MatrixOne It will take effect. When I was testing MatrixOne with MO-tester, I got an error of too many open files ? MO-tester will open and close many SQL files in a high speed to test MatrixOne, this kind of usage will easily reach the maximum open file limit of Linux and macOS, which is the reason for the too many open files error. For MacOS, you can just set the open file limit by a simple command: ulimit -n 65536 For Linux, please refer to this detailed guide to set the ulimit to 100000. After setting this value, there will be no more too many open files error.

I built MatrixOne in the main branch initially but encountered panic when switching to other versions for building The storage formats between MatrixOne version 0.8.0 and its earlier versions are not compatible with each other. This means that when executing make build , the system will automatically generate a data directory file named mo-data to store data. In the future, if you need to switch to another branch and re-execute make build to build MatrixOne, it may cause a panic situation to occur. In this case, you need first to clean the mo-data data directory (that is, execute the rm -rf mo-data command), and then rebuild MatrixOne. Reference code example: [root ~]# cd matrixone // Go to the matrixone directory [root ~]# git branch // Check the current branch * 0.8.0 [root ~]# make build // Build matrixone ... // The build process code is omitted here. If you want to switch to another version, such as version 0.7.0, [root ~]# git checkout 0.7.0 // Switch to version 0.7.0 [root ~]# rm -rf mo-data // Clean up the data directory [root ~]# make build // Build matrixone again ... // The build process code is omitted here [root ~]# ./mo-service --daemon --launch ./etc/quickstart/launch.toml &> test.log & // Start MatrixOne service in the terminal backend Note The MatrixOne version 0.8.0 is compatible with the storage format of older versions.

For unsupported features, see MySQL Compatibility , and for more information on connecting to MatriOne, see Using client connect to the MatrixOne server . What is SQL? The Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to manage a relational database management system (RDBMS). The scope of SQL includes data insertion, query, update, and delete, database schema creation and modification, and data access control. How many types SQL does MatrixOne have? SQL is divided into the following 6 types according to their functions in MatrixOne: DDL (Data Definition Language): It is used to define database objects, including databases, tables, and views. Such as CREATE , ALTER , and DROP . DML (Data Manipulation Language): It is used to manipulate application related records. Such as SELECT , DELETE , and INSERT . DQL (Data Query Language): It is used to query the records after conditional filtering. Such as SELECT...FROM...[WHERE] . TCL (Transaction Control Language): It is used to manage transactions. Such as COMMIT , ROLLBACK , or SET TRANSACTION . DCL (Data Control Language): It is used to define access privileges and security levels. Such as CREATET ACCOUNT , DROP ACCOUNT , and GRANT . Other: Other types of management languages \u200b\u200bin MatrixOne are not directly related to data and are a general term for the acquisition and modification of database parameters and resource allocation. Such as SHOW , SET variable , and KILL . Basic SQL about SHOW, CREATE and DROP a database A database in MatrixOne can be considered as a collection of objects such as tables . To show the list of databases, use the SHOW DATABASES statement: SHOW DATABASES ; To create the database named dbdemo , use the CREATE DATABASE db_name [options]; statement, for example: CREATE DATABASE dbdemo ; or: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dbdemo ; Add IF NOT EXISTS to prevent an error if the database exists. To use the database named dbdemo , use the following statement: USE dbdemo ; To show all the tables in a database, use the SHOW TABLES statement: SHOW TABLES FROM dbdemo ; To delete a database, use the DROP DATABASE statement: DROP DATABASE dbdemo ; Basic SQL about CREATE, SHOW, and DROP a table To create a table, use the CREATE TABLE statement: CREATE TABLE table_name column_name data_type constraint ; For example, to create a table named person which includes fields such as number , name , and birthday , use the following statement: CREATE TABLE person ( id INT ( 11 ), name VARCHAR ( 255 ), birthday DATE ); To view the statement that creates the table (DDL), use the SHOW CREATE statement: SHOW CREATE table person ; Expected result: + --------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Table | Create Table | + --------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | person | CREATE TABLE ` person ` ( ` id ` INT DEFAULT NULL , ` name ` VARCHAR ( 255 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` birthday ` DATE DEFAULT NULL ) | + --------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) To delete a table, use the DROP TABLE statement: DROP TABLE person ; Basic SQL about INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data Common DML features are adding, modifying, and deleting table records. The corresponding commands are INSERT , UPDATE , and DELETE . To insert data into a table, use the INSERT statement: INSERT INTO person VALUES ( 1 , 'tom' , '20170912' ); To insert a record containing data of some fields into a table, use the INSERT statement: INSERT INTO person ( id , name ) VALUES ( '2' , 'bob' ); To update some fields of a record in a table, use the UPDATE statement: UPDATE person SET birthday = '20180808' WHERE id = 2 ; To delete the data in a table, use the DELETE statement: DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 2 ; Note The UPDATE and DELETE statements without the WHERE clause as a filter operate on the entire table. Basic SQL about Query data DQL is used to retrieve the desired data rows from a table or multiple tables. To view the data in a table, use the SELECT statement: SELECT * FROM person ; Expected result: + ------+------+------------+ | id | name | birthday | + ------+------+------------+ | 1 | tom | 2017 - 09 - 12 | + ------+------+------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) To query a specific column, add the column name after the SELECT keyword: SELECT name FROM person ; + ------+ | name | + ------+ | tom | + ------+ 1 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) Use the WHERE clause to filter all records that match the conditions and then return the result: SELECT * FROM person where id < 5 ; Expected result: + ------+------+------------+ | id | name | birthday | + ------+------+------------+ | 1 | tom | 2017 - 09 - 12 | + ------+------+------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) Basic SQL about CREATE, GRANT, and DROP a user CREATE , GRANT , and DROP are usually used to create or delete users, and manage user privileges. To create a user, use the CREATE USER statement. The following example creates a user named mouser with the password 111 : > CREATE USER mouser IDENTIFIED BY '111' ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0 . 10 sec ) To create a role for the user: > CREATE ROLE role_r1 ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0 . 05 sec ) To grant mouser the role_r1: > GRANT role_r1 to mouser ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0 . 04 sec ) To grant mouser the privilege to create table in the dbdemo database: GRANT create table on database * to role_r1 ; To check the privileges of mouser: > SHOW GRANTS for mouser @ localhost ; + -------------------------------------------------------+ | Grants for mouser @ localhost | + -------------------------------------------------------+ | GRANT create table ON database * ` mouser `@` localhost ` | | GRANT connect ON account ` mouser `@` localhost ` | + -------------------------------------------------------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 02 sec ) You have successfully granted the permission of create table in the database to mouser . To delete mouser: DROP USER mouser ; Privilege management is a huge but very useful function.

Backups are also essential as a safeguard before upgrading a MatrixOne installation, and they can be used to transfer a MatrixOne building to another system. MatrixOne currently only supports logical backup through the modump utility. modump is a command-line utility used to generate the logical backup of the MatrixOne database. It produces SQL Statements that can be used to recreate the database objects and data. You can look up the syntax and usage guide in the modump chapter. We will take a simple example to walk you through the backup and restore process with the modump utility. Steps 1.

MatrixOne maintains a high degree of compatibility with MySQL syntax, so the syntax adjustments that need to be made during the migration process are minimal. Nevertheless, there are still some differences between MatrixOne and MySQL in terms of data types and data objects, which requires some adjustments in the migration process. Data type difference In MatrixOne, while maintaining the same name as MySQL, there are slight differences in accuracy and range between data types and MySQL. For more information, see Data Types . Online Migration This chapter will guide you to use third-party tools to migrate data from MySQL to MatrixOne. Applicable scenarios: scenarios where the amount of data is small (recommended less than 1GB), and the migration speed is not sensitive. Preparation Springboard machine with a graphical interface: it can connect to the source of MySQL and the target of MatrixOne. Data Migration Tool: Download DBeaver on the springboard machine. Step 1: Migrate table structure Here we take the TPCH dataset as an example and migrate the 8 tables of the TPCH dataset from MySQL to MatrixOne. Open DBeaver, select the table to be migrated from MySQL, right-click and select Generate SQL > DDL Click Copy , first copy this SQL to a text editor for text editing Name the filer as tpch_ddl.sql and save it locally on the springboard machine. Use the following command to replace keywords not supported by MatrixOne in the tpch_ddl.sql file: # The commands executed by the Linux system are as follows: sed -i 's/ ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci//g' /YOUR_PATH/tpch_ddl.sql # The commands executed by the MacOS system are as follows: sed -i '' 's/ ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci//g' /YOUR_PATH/tpch_ddl.sql Connect to MatrixOne and create a new database and table in MatrixOne: create database tpch ; use tpch ; source '/YOUR_PATH/tpch_ddl.sql' Step 2: Migrate data Open DBeaver, select the table to be migrated from MySQL, right-click and select Export Data : In the Conversion Target > Export Target window, select Database , click Next ; in the Table Mapping window, select Target Container , and select the MatrixOne database for the target container tpch : In the Extraction Settings and Data Loading Settings windows, set the number of selected extractions and inserts. To trigger MatrixOne's direct write S3 strategy, it is recommended to fill in 5000: After completing the settings, DBeaver starts to migrate the data, and after completion, DBeaver will prompt that the migration is successful. Step 3: Check the data After the migration is complete, the data can be inspected as follows: Use select count(*) from <table_name> to confirm whether the data volume of the source database and target databases' data volume is consistent. Compare the results through related queries; you can also refer to the Complete TPCH testing query example to compare the results. Offline Migration This chapter will guide you through importing to MatrixOne through offline files. Applicable scenarios: scenarios with a large amount of data (more significant than 1GB) and sensitive to migration speed. Preparation Springboard machine with a graphical interface: it can be connected to the source end of MySQL and the target end of MatrixOne. Data Migration Tool: Download DBeaver to the springboard machine. Install mysqldump . If you are not familiar with how to use mysqldump , see mysqldump tutorial Step 1: Migrate table structure Here we take the TPCH dataset as an example and migrate the 8 tables of the TPCH dataset from MySQL to MatrixOne. Open DBeaver, select the table to be migrated from MySQL, right-click and select Generate SQL > DDL > Copy , first copy this SQL to a text editor, and name the text editor tpch_ddl.sql , saved locally on the springboard machine. Use the following command to replace keywords that MatrixOne does not support in the tpch_ddl.sql file: # The commands executed by the Linux system are as follows: $ sed -i 's/ ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci//g' /YOUR_PATH/tpch_ddl.sql # The commands executed by the MacOS system are as follows: sed -i '' 's/ ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci//g' /YOUR_PATH/tpch_ddl.sql Connect to MatrixOne and create a new database and table in MatrixOne: create database tpch ; use tpch ; source '/YOUR_PATH/tpch_ddl.sql' Step 2: Migrate data MatrixOne has two data migration methods to choose from: INSERT and LOAD DATA . When the amount of data is greater than 1GB, it is recommended to use LOAD DATA first, followed by INSERT . LOAD DATA Use LOAD DATA to export the MySQL data table to CSV format first, and use MatrixOne's parallel LOAD function to migrate the data to MatrixOne: Use mysqldump to export the MySQL data table as a CSV format file. Make sure you have write access to the file path and check the secure_file_priv configuration: mysqldump - u root - p - t - T / { filepath } tpch --fields-terminated-by='|' Connect to MatrixOne and import the exported CSV data into MatrixOne: mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/lineitem.txt' INTO TABLE lineitem FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/nation.txt' INTO TABLE nation FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/part.txt' INTO TABLE part FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/customer.txt' INTO TABLE customer FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/orders.txt' INTO TABLE orders FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/supplier.txt' INTO TABLE supplier FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/region.txt' INTO TABLE region FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; mysql > load data infile '/{filepath}/partsupp.txt' INTO TABLE partsupp FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' lines TERMINATED BY '\\n' parallel 'true' ; For more operation examples of LOAD DATA , see Bulk Load Overview . INSERT The INSERT statement needs to use mysqldump to export the logical statement first and then import it into MatrixOne: Use mysqldump to export data. To ensure that MatrixOne directly writes to S3 when inserting, inserting as large a batch as possible is recommended. The net_buffer_length parameter should start at 10MB: mysqldump - t tpch - uroot - p --net_buffer_length=10m > tpch_data.sql On the MatrixOne side, execute the SQL file, there will be an error message during the process, but it will not affect the data insertion: source '/YOUR_PATH/tpch_data.sql' For more examples of INSERT operations, see Insert Data . Step 3: Check the data After the migration is complete, the data can be inspected as follows: Use select count(*) from <table_name> to confirm whether the data volume of the source database and target databases' data volume is consistent. Compare the results through related queries; you can also refer to the Complete a TPCH Test with MatrixOne query example to compare the results.

Use the following command to replace keywords not supported by MatrixOne in the oracle_ddl.sql file: # The commands executed by the Linux system are as follows: sed -i '/CHECK (/d' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '/CREATE UNIQUE INDEX/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i 's/NUMBER(3,0)/smallint/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i 's/NUMBER(5,0)/smallint/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i 's/NUMBER(10,0)/int/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i 's/NUMBER(38,0)/bigint/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i 's/NUMBER/decimal/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i 's/VARCHAR2/varchar/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql # The commands executed by the MacOS system are as follows: sed -i '' '/CHECK (/d' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '' '/CREATE UNIQUE INDEX/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '' 's/NUMBER(3,0)/smallint/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '' 's/NUMBER(5,0)/smallint/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '' 's/NUMBER(10,0)/int/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '' 's/NUMBER(38,0)/bigint/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '' 's/NUMBER/decimal/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql sed -i '' 's/VARCHAR2/varchar/g' /YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql Connect to MatrixOne and create a new database and table in MatrixOne: create database tpch ; use tpch ; source '/YOUR_PATH/oracle_ddl.sql' Step 2: Migrate data Open DBeaver, select the table to be migrated from Oracle, right-click and select Export Data : In the Conversion Target > Export Target window, select Database , click Next ; in the Table Mapping window, select Target Container , and select the MatrixOne database for the target container tpch : In the Extraction Settings and Data Loading Settings windows, set the number of selected extractions and inserts. To trigger MatrixOne's direct write S3 strategy, it is recommended to fill in 5000: After completing the settings, DBeaver starts to migrate the data, and after completion, DBeaver will prompt that the migration is successful. Step 3: Check the data After the migration is complete, the data can be inspected as follows: Use select count(*) from <table_name> to confirm whether the data volume of the source database and target databases' data volume is consistent. Compare the results through related queries; you can also refer to the Complete TPCH testing query example to compare the results. Offline Migration This chapter will guide you through importing to MatrixOne through offline files.

a structure that separates storage, computation, and transactions to form a consolidated HSTAP data engine. This engine enables a single database system to accommodate diverse business loads such as OLTP, OLAP, and stream computing. It also supports deployment and utilization across public, private, and edge clouds, ensuring compatibility with diverse infrastructures. MatrixOne touts significant features, including real-time HTAP, multi-tenancy, stream computation, extreme scalability, cost-effectiveness, enterprise-grade availability, and extensive MySQL compatibility. MatrixOne unifies tasks traditionally performed by multiple databases into one system by offering a comprehensive ultra-hybrid data solution. This consolidation simplifies development and operations, minimizes data fragmentation, and boosts development agility. MatrixOne is optimally suited for scenarios requiring real-time data input, large data scales, frequent load fluctuations, and a mix of procedural and analytical business operations. It caters to use cases such as mobile internet apps, IoT data applications, real-time data warehouses, SaaS platforms, and more. Key Features Hyper-converged Engine Monolithic Engine HTAP data engine that supports a mix of workloads such as TP, AP, time series, and machine learning within a single database. Built-in Streaming Engine Built-in stream computing engine that enables real-time data inflow, transformation, and querying. Cloud & Edge Native Storage-Computation Separation Structure Separates the storage, computation, and transaction layers, leveraging a containerized design for ultimate scalability. Multi-Infrastructure Compatibility MatrixOne provides industry-leading latency control with optimized consistency protocol. Extreme Performance High-Performance Execution Engine The flexible combination of Compute Node and Data Node accommodates point queries and batch processing, delivering peak performance for OLTP and OLAP. Enterprise-Grade High Availability Establishes a consistently shared log under a leading Multi-Raft replication state machine model. It ensures high cluster availability while preventing data duplication, thus achieving RTO=0. Ease of Use Built-in Multi-Tenancy Capability Offers inherent multi-tenancy, where tenants are isolated from each other, independently scalable yet uniformly manageable. This feature simplifies the complexity of multi-tenancy design in upper-level applications. High Compatibility with MySQL MatrixOne exhibits high compatibility with MySQL 8.0, including transmission protocol, SQL syntax, and ecosystem tools, lowering usage and migration barriers. Cost-Effective Efficient Storage Design Employs cost-effective object storage as primary storage. High availability can be achieved through erasure coding technology with only about 150% data redundancy. It also provides high-speed caching capabilities, balancing cost and performance via a multi-tiered storage strategy that separates hot and cold data. Flexible Resource Allocation Users can adjust the resource allocation ratio for OLTP and OLAP according to business conditions, maximizing resource utilization. Enterprise-Level Security and Compliance MatrixOne employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), TLS connections, and data encryption to establish a multi-tiered security defense system, safeguarding enterprise-level data security and compliance. User Values Simplify Database Management and Maintenance With business evolution, the number of data engines and middleware enterprises employ increases. Each data engine relies on 5+ essential components and stores 3+ data replicas. Each engine must be independently installed, monitored, patched, and upgraded. This results in high and uncontrollable data engine selection, development, and operations costs. Under MatrixOne's unified architecture, users can employ a single database to serve multiple data applications, reducing the number of introduced data components and technology stacks by 80% and significantly simplifying database management and maintenance costs. Reduce Data Fragmentation and Inconsistency Data flow and copy between databases make data sync and consistency increasingly tricky. The unified and incrementally materialized view of MatrixOne allows the downstream to support real-time upstream updates and achieve end-to-end data processing without redundant ETL processes. Decoupling Data Architecture From Infrastructure Currently, the architecture design across different infrastructures is complicated, causing new data silos between cloud and edge, cloud and on-premise. MatrixOne is designed with a unified architecture to support simplified data management and operations across different infrastructures. Extremely Fast Complex Query Performance Poor business agility results from slow, complex queries and redundant intermediate tables in current data warehousing solutions. MatrixOne supports blazing-fast experience even for star and snowflake schema queries, improving business agility with real-time analytics. An Solid OLTP-like OLAP Experience Current data warehousing solutions have the following problems: high latency and absence of immediate visibility for data updates. MatrixOne brings OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) level consistency and high availability to CRUD operations in OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). Seamless and Non-disruptive Scaling It is challenging to balance performance and scalability to achieve an optimum price-performance ratio in current data warehousing solutions. MatrixOne's disaggregated storage and compute architecture makes it fully automated and efficient to scale in/out and up/down without disrupting applications. Scenarios Traditional Application System Scenarios Requiring Scalability and Analytical Reporting Capabilities With the expansion of businesses, the performance needs of traditional single-machine databases cannot meet enterprises' usual systems such as OA, ERP, CRM, etc., especially during special periods requiring business analysis. Many enterprises equip a separate analytical database system to meet statistical report needs at essential points like month-end, quarter-end, etc. Using MatrixOne; these needs can be met with a single database system, providing strong scalability that seamlessly scales with business growth. Dashboard/BI Report Scenarios Requiring Real-Time Analytical Capabilities For typical OLAP-type applications in enterprises, such as dashboards, BI reports, etc., analyzing massive amounts of data often leads to a performance bottleneck when the data volume is significantly large, resulting in poor timeliness. MatrixOne's robust analysis performance and scalability enable the acceleration of various complex and large-scale SQL queries, providing a near-instant experience and enhancing enterprise decision-making analysis's agility. Data Platform Scenarios for Real-Time Influx and Processing of Massive Heterogeneous Data Applications With the extensive use of sensor and network technology, numerous IoT devices generate substantial data, such as manufacturing factory production lines, new energy vehicles, city security surveillance cameras, etc. Their scale can easily reach hundreds of TB or even PB levels. The demand for digitization also requires enterprises to store and use these data increasingly. Traditional database solutions cannot meet the requirements of such massive and large-scale real-time data writing and processing applications. MatrixOne's powerful streaming data writing and processing capabilities and robust scalability can adapt to any load and data volume scale, fully meeting these requirements. Data Middle-End Scenarios Where Various Internal Enterprise Data Converges Medium and large enterprises often have multiple business systems. To fully understand the enterprise's overall status, many enterprises build a data middle-end that connects data sources from various systems. Traditional solutions to carry the data middle-end are based on the Hadoop system, which is complex, posing high development and operation thresholds for many enterprises. MatrixOne's one-stop HTAP architecture makes using a data middle-end as convenient as using MySQL, significantly reducing costs. Business Scenarios with Dramatic and Frequent Internet Business Fluctuations Internet applications such as games, e-commerce, entertainment, social networking, news, etc., have a massive user base, and the business fluctuates dramatically and frequently. During hot events, these applications often need many computing resources to support business needs. MatrixOne's fully cloud-native architecture has superior scalability, enabling automatic and rapid scaling with business changes, significantly reducing user operation and maintenance difficulties. Enterprise SaaS Service Business Scenarios Enterprise SaaS applications have seen explosive growth in recent years. In developing SaaS applications, they all need to consider their multi-tenant model. Traditional schemes offer two modes of multi-tenant shared database instances and single-tenant exclusive database instances, but they face the dilemma of management cost and isolation. MatrixOne comes with multi-tenant capabilities; tenants are naturally load-isolated and can be independently scaled. At the same time, it provides unified management capabilities, balancing the enterprise's needs for cost, management simplicity, and isolation, making it an optimal choice for SaaS applications.

The demand for digitization also requires enterprises to store and use these data increasingly. Traditional database solutions cannot meet the requirements of such massive and large-scale real-time data writing and processing applications. MatrixOne's powerful streaming data writing and processing capabilities and robust scalability can adapt to any load and data volume scale, fully meeting these requirements. Data Middle-End Scenarios Where Various Internal Enterprise Data Converges Medium and large enterprises often have multiple business systems. To fully understand the enterprise's overall status, many enterprises build a data middle-end that connects data sources from various systems. Traditional solutions to carry the data middle-end are based on the Hadoop system, which is complex, posing high development and operation thresholds for many enterprises. MatrixOne's one-stop HTAP architecture makes using a data middle-end as convenient as using MySQL, significantly reducing costs. Business Scenarios with Dramatic and Frequent Internet Business Fluctuations Internet applications such as games, e-commerce, entertainment, social networking, news, etc., have a massive user base, and the business fluctuates dramatically and frequently. During hot events, these applications often need many computing resources to support business needs. MatrixOne's fully cloud-native architecture has superior scalability, enabling automatic and rapid scaling with business changes, significantly reducing user operation and maintenance difficulties. Enterprise SaaS Service Business Scenarios Enterprise SaaS applications have seen explosive growth in recent years. In developing SaaS applications, they all need to consider their multi-tenant model. Traditional schemes offer two modes of multi-tenant shared database instances and single-tenant exclusive database instances, but they face the dilemma of management cost and isolation. MatrixOne comes with multi-tenant capabilities; tenants are naturally load-isolated and can be independently scaled. At the same time, it provides unified management capabilities, balancing the enterprise's needs for cost, management simplicity, and isolation, making it an optimal choice for SaaS applications.","title":"Scenarios"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/matrixone-introduction/#learn-more","text":"This section describes the basic introduction of MatrixOne.

This design allows MatrixOne to maintain excellent performance while keeping operating costs low. Technical Architecture In the overall architecture of MatrixOne, two parts are responsible for persistent data storage. One is the object storage shared by the entire MatrixOne distributed cluster, which is the primary storage device of the cluster. The other is the local storage on each compute node (CN), mainly used for data caching. The primary storage contains all data of the entire cluster, while the cache only saves data extracted from the primary storage during recent queries. In addition, the memory of CN nodes is also used as part of the data cache. When a user initiates a query, the system first checks whether the cache of the CN to which the user is connected already contains the required data. If it exists, the system directly returns the result to the user, prioritizing memory over disk. Suppose the required data is not found in the cache of the currently connected CN. In that case, the system queries the global metadata information to see if the required data exists in the cache of other available CNs for this user, checking memory first and then disk. If it exists, the system redirects the request to the CN containing this data, processes it, and returns the result to the user. If the data searched for is not in the cache of any available CN, the system initiates a read request to the object storage and returns the result to the user. When a user queries data from object storage, the queried data block will be filled into the corresponding position according to the cache query order. For example, if a user queries 100M of data from object storage, this 100M of data will first be written into the memory of the CN node to which the user is connected and then written into the disk cache of this CN node. Each time a new query is generated, the data in the cache will be updated according to this rule. Whether in memory or disk, data replacement in the CN cache follows the LRU (Least Recently Used) principle. With this mechanism, the most recent data is always in the easiest-to-get position, while relatively unpopular data will gradually be removed from the cache. Product Features The features of data caching and hot-cold data separation bring unique advantages to the product. To show more specifically, we will show a simple example. Environment Configuration The environment introduced in this chapter will be based on the environment of MatrixOne Distributed Cluster Deployment . Please ensure that the entire MatrixOne is installed. Prepare a table named pe and the corresponding CSV data. This CSV data table is 35.8MB, with 1,048,575 rows of data. We will use the following SQL statement to create two databases and load the same data table into the pe table in both databases. create database stock ; drop table if exists stock . pe ; create table stock . pe ( ts_code VARCHAR ( 255 ) DEFAULT null , trade_date VARCHAR ( 255 ) DEFAULT null , pe FLOAT DEFAULT null , pb FLOAT DEFAULT null ); load data local infile '/XXX/pe.csv' into table stock . pe fields TERMINATED BY '\\t' ; create database stock2 ; drop table if exists stock2 . pe ; create table stock2 . pe ( ts_code VARCHAR ( 255 ) DEFAULT null , trade_date VARCHAR ( 255 ) DEFAULT null , pe FLOAT DEFAULT null , pb FLOAT DEFAULT null ); load data local infile '/XXX/pe.csv' into table stock . pe fields TERMINATED BY '\\t' ; Next, perform the corresponding cache configuration. In the cluster yaml settings of MatrixOne, DN, Log Service, and CN all have cache-related settings. However, you only need to focus on the CN cache directly related to the query, and the primary cache size is managed by memoryCacheSize and diskCacheSize . metadata : name : mo namespace : mo-hn spec : cnGroups : - name : cn-set1 # Intermediate configuration omitted sharedStorageCache : # Core parameters for configuring CN cache memoryCacheSize : 250Mi # CN's memory cache, Mi stands for MB diskCacheSize : 1Gi # CN's disk cache, Gi stands for GB When both parameters are set to \"1\", the cache is turned off, and all query requests from MatrixOne will interact directly with the underlying object storage, significantly reducing the efficiency of queries. To simplify the display, you can first turn off the memory cache here and only set a specific size of the disk cache. Since the original data will be compressed to a particular ratio according to the data type after being stored, you need to set the disk cache to 20MB first, which is enough to store the compressed 35.8MB data file. metadata : name : mo namespace : mo-hn spec : cnGroups : - name : cn-set1 ## Omitted intermediate configuration sharedStorageCache : # Core parameters for configuring CN cache memoryCacheSize : \"1\" # CN's memory cache, Mi stands for MB diskCacheSize : 20Mi # CN's disk cache, Gi stands for GB Query Acceleration After completing the above settings and starting the MatrixOne cluster, you can experience the effect of cache acceleration through the results of multiple queries. Here, you can run a full table scan of stock.pe multiple times in a row. mysql > select * from stock . pe into outfile \"test01.txt\" ; Empty set ( 6 . 53 sec ) mysql > select * from stock . pe into outfile \"test02.txt\" ; Empty set ( 4 . 01 sec ) mysql > select * from stock . pe into outfile \"test03.txt\" ; Empty set ( 3 . 84 sec ) mysql > select * from stock . pe into outfile \"test04.txt\" ; Empty set ( 3 . 96 sec ) The above results show that the first query is noticeably slower because it needs to fetch data from object storage. However, since the data has been cached to the disk in the subsequent three queries, the query speed has significantly improved. Cache Replacement Next, you can alternate and run a full table scan of stock.pe and stock2.pe multiple times. mysql > select * from stock2 . pe into outfile \"test05.txt\" ; Empty set ( 5 . 84 sec ) mysql > select * from stock2 . pe into outfile \"test06.txt\" ; Empty set ( 4 . 27 sec ) mysql > select * from stock2 . pe into outfile \"test07.txt\" ; Empty set ( 4 . 15 sec ) mysql > select * from stock . pe into outfile \"test08.txt\" ; Empty set ( 6 . 37 sec ) mysql > select * from stock . pe into outfile \"test09.txt\" ; Empty set ( 4 . 14 sec ) mysql > select * from stock . pe into outfile \"test10.txt\" ; Empty set ( 3 . 81 sec ) You might notice that each time the data table for the query is switched, the query efficiency significantly decreases. This is due to the cache replacement mechanism. You only set a small cache, which is just enough to store the complete data of a table. Therefore, when you alternate queries, the old cache data is replaced. The new query needs to fetch data from the object storage, and when queried again, since the data has been cached, the query speed is improved. Query Preheating In many business scenarios, we often need to accelerate the queries due to a large amount of data or complex queries. The cache mechanism of MatrixOne can accelerate queries by preheating the data. For example, the following SQL query: SELECT pe1 . ts_code , pe1 . pe , pe1 . pb FROM stock2 . pe as pe1 WHERE pe1 . pe = ( SELECT min ( pe2 . pe ) FROM stock2 . pe as pe2 WHERE pe1 . ts_code = pe2 . ts_code ) ORDER BY trade_date DESC LIMIT 1 ; If not optimized, the execution speed is as follows: SELECT pe1 . ts_code , pe1 . pe , pe1 . pb FROM stock2 . pe as pe1 WHERE pe1 . pe = ( SELECT min ( pe2 . pe ) FROM stock2 . pe as pe2 WHERE pe1 . ts_code = pe2 . ts_code ) ORDER BY trade_date DESC LIMIT 1 ; + -----------+------+--------+ | ts_code | pe | pb | + -----------+------+--------+ | 000038 . SZ | 0 | 1 . 2322 | + -----------+------+--------+ 1 row in set ( 5 . 21 sec ) This SQL query only involves the query of the stock2.pe table. We can preheat the table data to the cache by pre-scanning the complete table data, so the query can significantly improve the speed of this SQL query. mysql > select * from stock2 . pe into outfile \"test11.txt\" ; Empty set ( 6 . 48 sec ) mysql > SELECT pe1 . ts_code , pe1 . pe , pe1 . pb FROM stock2 . pe as pe1 WHERE pe1 . pe = ( SELECT min ( pe2 . pe ) FROM stock2 . pe as pe2 WHERE pe1 . ts_code = pe2 . ts_code ) ORDER BY trade_date DESC LIMIT 1 ; + -----------+------+---------+ | ts_code | pe | pb | + -----------+------+---------+ | 000068 . SZ | 0 | 14 . 6959 | + -----------+------+---------+ 1 row in set ( 2 . 21 sec ) This feature is particularly suitable for some fixed report calculation scenarios. Users can preheat the data involved in the query and then perform the query, which can significantly improve the query effect.","title":"Detailed Caching and Hot-Cold Data Separation Architecture"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-cold-hot-data-separation/#detailed-caching-and-hot-cold-data-separation-architecture","text":"Data caching and hot-cold data separation are key features of MatrixOne, where data is classified into hot and cold based on the frequency of use and managed differently.

It is an independent service used by external components through RPC for log management. Logservice uses the dragonboat library based on the Raft protocol (a multi-raft group's Go language open source implementation) and usually uses local disks to store logs in multiple copies, similar to the management of WAL (Write-Ahead Log). The transaction commits must only be written to the Logservice without writing the data to S3. Additional components write batches of data to S3 asynchronously. Such a design ensures low latency when the transaction commits, and multiple copies provide high data reliability. Logservice Architecture The architecture of Logservice consists of two parts: client and server. The server includes modules such as handler, dragonboat, and RSM (Replicated State Machine), while the client includes several key interfaces. The collaborative relationship between them is shown in the figure below: Client Logservice client is mainly invoked by DN (data node) and provides the following key interfaces: Close() : Close the client connection. Config() : Get client-related configuration. GetLogRecord() : returns a pb.LogRecord variable containing an 8-byte LSN (log sequence number), a 4-byte record type, and a data field of type []byte . The data field consists of 4 bytes for pb.UserEntryUpdate , 8 for the replica DN ID, and payload []byte . Append() : Append pb.LogRecord to Logservice and return LSN. The parameter pb.LogRecord can be reused on the calling side. Read() : Read logs starting from the specified firstLsn from the Logservice until maxSize is reached. The returned LSN is used as the starting point for the next read. Truncate() : Delete the logs before the specified LSN to free up disk space. GetTruncatedLsn() : Returns the LSN of the most recently deleted log. GetTSOTimestamp() : Request the specified timestamps from TSO (Timestamp Oracle). The caller occupies the scope of [returned value, returned value + count] . This method currently needs to be used. The Logservice client sends a request to the Logservice server through MO-RPC, and the server interacts with Raft / dragonboat and returns the result. Server Server Handler The server side of Logservice receives requests from clients and handles them. The entry function is (*Service).handle() , and different requests are processed by calling other methods: Append: Appends logs to Logservice, ultimately invoking the (*NodeHost) SyncPropose() method of Dragonboat for synchronous proposal. It waits for the log to be committed and applied before returning, and the return value is the LSN (Log Sequence Number) after a successful log write. Read: Reads log entries from the log database. It first calls the (*NodeHost) SyncRead() method to perform a linear read from the state machine up to the current LSN and then calls the (*NodeHost) QueryRaftLog() method to read log entries from the log database based on the LSN. Truncate: Truncates logs in the log database to free up disk space. It's important to note that here, only the latest truncatable LSN in the state machine is updated, and the actual truncation operation still needs to be performed. Connect: Establishes a connection with the Logservice server and attempts to read and write the state machine for state checking. Heartbeat: Includes heartbeats to Logservice, CN, and DN. This request updates the status information of each entity in the HAKeeper's state machine and synchronizes the tick of HAKeeper. When the HAKeeper performs checks, it compares the offline time based on the tick, and if it's offline, it triggers removal or shutdown operations. Get XXX: Retrieves relevant information from the state machine. Bootstrap Bootstrap is the process that occurs when the logservice server starts, and it is carried out through HAKeeper's shard ID 0. The entry function is (*Service) BootstrapHAKeeper . Regardless of how many replicas are configured, each logservice process starts a replica of HAKeeper during startup. Each replica sets up members (replicas) upon startup, and the HAKeeper shard starts Raft with these members as the default replica count. After completing the leader election in Raft, it executes setting the initial cluster information ( set initial cluster info ), sets the shard to count for logs and DNs, and sets the replica count for logs. Once the replica count is set, any excess HAKeeper replicas will be stopped. Heartbeat This heartbeat is sent from Logservice, CN, and DN to HAKeeper, rather than being a heartbeat between Raft replicas. It serves two primary purposes: Sending the status information of each replica to HAKeeper through heartbeats, allowing HAKeeper's state machine to update replica information. Retrieving commands that replicas need to execute from HAKeeper upon heartbeat response. The heartbeat process in Logservice is illustrated in the following diagram, and the process is similar for CN and DN. By default, the heartbeat is executed once per second, and its mechanism is as follows: Generate heartbeat information for all shard replicas on the storage level, including shard ID, node information, term, leader, etc. Send the request to the server side of Logservice. Upon receiving the request, the server invokes the (*Service) handleLogHeartbeat() method to process it and uses propose to send the heartbeat to Raft. Upon receiving the heartbeat, the state machine of HAKeeper calls the (*stateMachine) handleLogHeartbeat() method to process it, primarily performing the following tasks: Updating the LogState in the state machine: Invoking the (*LogState) Update() method to update storage and shard information. Retrieving commands from the ScheduleCommands of the state machine and returning them to the initiating end for execution. The principles of CN and DN sending heartbeats to HAKeeper are also similar. Replicated State Machine (RSM) Logservice and HAKeeper have an in-memory replicated state machine model where all data is stored in memory. They both implement the IStateMachine interface, and the key methods are as follows: Update() : After completing a propose and commit (i.e., when a majority of replicas have finished writing), the Update() method is called to update the data in the state machine. The user implements the Update() method and must be side-effect free, meaning that the same input must yield the same output. Otherwise, it can lead to an unstable state machine. The results of the Update() method are returned through the Result structure, and if an error occurs, the error field is not empty. Lookup() : Used to retrieve data from the state machine. The data type to be retrieved is specified through the interface{} parameter, and the result is also of type interface{} . Therefore, users need to define the data in the state machine, pass the corresponding data type, and then perform type assertion. Lookup() is a read-only method and should not modify the data in the state machine. SaveSnapshot() : Creates a snapshot by writing the data from the state machine to an io.Writer interface, typically a file handle. Thus, the snapshot is ultimately saved to a local disk file. ISnapshotFileCollection represents a list of files outside the state machine's file system (if any), which will also be stored in the snapshot. The third parameter is to notify the snapshot process that the Raft replica has stopped, terminating the snapshot operation. RecoverFromSnapshot() : Recovers the state machine data by reading the latest snapshot data from an io.Reader . []SnapshotFile represents an additional list of files directly copied to the state machine's data directory. The third parameter controls the snapshot operation's recovery, stopping it when Raft replica operations are being performed. Close() : Closes the state machine and performs any necessary cleanup tasks. Read-Write Process In Logservice, the general process for a read-write request is as follows: Write Process The request is forwarded to the leader node if the connected node is not the leader. Upon receiving the request, the leader node writes the log entry to its local disk. Simultaneously, the request is asynchronously sent to follower nodes. Upon receiving the request, each follower node writes the log entry to its local disk. Once most nodes have completed the write, the commit index is updated, and other follower nodes are notified through heartbeat messages. The leader node executes the state machine operations (apply) after the write is committed. The result is returned to the client after the state machine operations are completed. Each follower node independently executes its state machine operations upon receiving the commit index from the leader. Read Process Reading data can be divided into two scenarios: Reading data from the state machine. The client initiates a read request, and when the request reaches the leader node, the current commit index is recorded. The leader node sends heartbeat requests to all nodes to confirm its leader status. Once most nodes respond and confirm it as the leader, it can respond to the read request. Wait for the apply index to be greater than or equal to the commit index. Once the condition is met, the data can be read from the state machine and returned to the client. Reading log entries from the log database (log db). This process typically occurs during cluster restart. During restart, replicas first need to recover the state machine data from the snapshot, then start reading log entries from the log database based on the index position recorded in the snapshot and apply them to the state machine. After this operation is completed, replicas can participate in leader elections. When a leader is elected in the cluster, the data nodes (DN) connect to the Logservice cluster and start reading log entries from the last checkpoint position of a replica's log database. These log entries are replayed into the data node's in-memory data. Truncation As the log entries in Logservice's log database continue to grow, it can lead to insufficient disk space. Therefore, regular disk space release is needed, achieved through truncation. Logservice uses an in-memory-based state machine that only stores some metadata and status information, such as tick, state, and LSN (Log Sequence Number), without recording user data. User data is recorded by the data nodes (DN) themselves. You can think of it as a master-slave architecture, where the state machines are separate, and the DN and Logservice maintain their respective state machines. In this design with separate state machines, a simple snapshot mechanism can cause issues: When a DN sends a truncation request and sets the truncation index to 100, the applied index of the Logservice's state machine is 200. This means that logs before index 200 will be deleted, and a snapshot will be generated at that position. Note: The truncation index is not equal to the applied index. The cluster restarts. The Logservice's state machine applies the snapshot with index 200, sets the first index to 200 (deleting logs before index 200), and replays logs before providing the service. When the DN reads log entries from Logservice, starting from index 100, it fails to read because the logs before index 200 have been deleted, resulting in an error. To address the above problem, the current truncation workflow is as follows: The DN sends a truncation request and updates the truncation LSN (truncateLsn) in the Logservice's state machine. Only the value is updated, and no snapshot/truncation operation is executed. Each Logservice server internally starts a truncation worker that periodically sends truncation requests (Truncate Request). It's important to note that the Exported parameter in this request is true, indicating that the snapshot is not visible to the system and is only exported to a specified directory. The truncation worker also checks the list of currently exported snapshots to see if there are any snapshots with an index greater than the truncation LSN in the Logservice's state machine. If there are, the snapshot closest to the truncation LSN is imported into the system to make it effective and visible to the system. All replicas perform the same operations to ensure that the snapshot LSN of both state machines is consistent.

The user implements the Update() method and must be side-effect free, meaning that the same input must yield the same output. Otherwise, it can lead to an unstable state machine.

Wait for the apply index to be greater than or equal to the commit index. Once the condition is met, the data can be read from the state machine and returned to the client. Reading log entries from the log database (log db). This process typically occurs during cluster restart. During restart, replicas first need to recover the state machine data from the snapshot, then start reading log entries from the log database based on the index position recorded in the snapshot and apply them to the state machine. After this operation is completed, replicas can participate in leader elections. When a leader is elected in the cluster, the data nodes (DN) connect to the Logservice cluster and start reading log entries from the last checkpoint position of a replica's log database. These log entries are replayed into the data node's in-memory data.","title":"Read Process"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-logservice/#truncation","text":"As the log entries in Logservice's log database continue to grow, it can lead to insufficient disk space. Therefore, regular disk space release is needed, achieved through truncation. Logservice uses an in-memory-based state machine that only stores some metadata and status information, such as tick, state, and LSN (Log Sequence Number), without recording user data. User data is recorded by the data nodes (DN) themselves. You can think of it as a master-slave architecture, where the state machines are separate, and the DN and Logservice maintain their respective state machines. In this design with separate state machines, a simple snapshot mechanism can cause issues: When a DN sends a truncation request and sets the truncation index to 100, the applied index of the Logservice's state machine is 200. This means that logs before index 200 will be deleted, and a snapshot will be generated at that position. Note: The truncation index is not equal to the applied index. The cluster restarts. The Logservice's state machine applies the snapshot with index 200, sets the first index to 200 (deleting logs before index 200), and replays logs before providing the service. When the DN reads log entries from Logservice, starting from index 100, it fails to read because the logs before index 200 have been deleted, resulting in an error. To address the above problem, the current truncation workflow is as follows: The DN sends a truncation request and updates the truncation LSN (truncateLsn) in the Logservice's state machine. Only the value is updated, and no snapshot/truncation operation is executed. Each Logservice server internally starts a truncation worker that periodically sends truncation requests (Truncate Request). It's important to note that the Exported parameter in this request is true, indicating that the snapshot is not visible to the system and is only exported to a specified directory. The truncation worker also checks the list of currently exported snapshots to see if there are any snapshots with an index greater than the truncation LSN in the Logservice's state machine. If there are, the snapshot closest to the truncation LSN is imported into the system to make it effective and visible to the system. All replicas perform the same operations to ensure that the snapshot LSN of both state machines is consistent. This allows reading the corresponding log entries when the cluster restarts.","title":"Truncation"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-proxy/","text":"Detailed Proxy Architecture Proxy, the sole component in MatrixOne responsible for load balancing and SQL request distribution, adapts to various scenarios by implementing session-level SQL routing through CN grouping and Proxy's SQL distribution.

As shown in the figure above, the technical implementation process is explained as follows: Create different CN labels through configuration options in the yaml file (including configuration, replica count, and tenant). When the MatrixOne cluster starts, MatrixOne will launch the same number of Pods according to the replica count of each CN label, and HAKeeper will uniformly apply the corresponding labels.

This combination of engines is called HSTAP. As a redefinition of the HTAP database, HSTAP aims to meet all the needs of Transactional Processing (TP) and Analytical Processing (AP) within a single database. Compared with the traditional HTAP, HSTAP emphasizes its built-in streaming capability used for connecting TP and AP tables. This provides users with an experience that a database can be used just like a Big Data platform, with which many users are already familiar thanks to the Big Data boom. With minimal integration efforts, MatrixOne frees users from the limitations of Big Data and provides one-stop coverage for all TP and AP scenarios for enterprises. MatrixOne Architecture Layers MatrixOne implements three independent layers, each with its object units and responsibilities. Different nodes can freely scale, no longer constrained by other layers. These three layers are: Compute Layer: Based on Compute Nodes (CNs), MatrixOne enables serverless computing and transaction processing with its cache, which is capable of random restarts and scaling. Transaction Layer: Based on Database Nodes and Log Services, MatrixOne provides complete logging services and metadata information, with built-in Logtail for recent data storage. Storage Layer: Full data is stored in object storage, represented by S3, implementing a low-cost, infinitely scalable storage method. A unified File Service enables seamless operations on underlying storage by different nodes. After deciding on TAE as the sole storage engine, multiple design adjustments were made to the fused TAE engine, resulting in the TAE storage engine. This engine has the following advantages: Columnar Storage Management: Uniform columnar storage and compression methods provide inherent performance advantages for OLAP businesses. Transaction Processing: Shared logs and DN nodes jointly support transaction processing for compute nodes. Hot and Cold Separation: Using S3 object storage as the target for File Service, each compute node has its cache. The compute engine is based on the fundamental goal of being compatible with MySQL, with higher requirements for node scheduling, execution plans, and SQL capabilities. The high-performance compute engine has both MPP (massively parallel processing) and experimental architecture: MySQL Compatible: Supports MySQL protocol and syntax. Fused Engine: Rebuilds execution plans based on DAG, capable of executing both TP and AP. Node Scheduling: Future support for adaptive intra-node and inter-node scheduling, meeting both concurrency and parallelism requirements. Comprehensive SQL Capability: Supports subqueries, window functions, CTE, and spill memory overflow processing. MatrixOne Architecture Design The MatrixOne architecture is as follows: The architecture of MatrixOne is divided into several layers: Cluster Management Layer Being responsible for cluster management, it interacts with Kubernetes to obtain resources dynamically when in the cloud-native environment, while in the on-premises deployment, it gets hold of resources based on the configuration. Cluster status is continuously monitored with the role of each node allocated based on resource information. Maintenance works are carried out to ensure that all system components are up and running despite occasional node and network failures. It rebalances the loads on nodes when necessary as well. Major components in this layer are: Prophet Scheduler: take charge of load balancing and node keep-alive. Resource Manager: being responsible for physical resources provision. Serverless Layer Serverless Layer is a general term for a series of stateless nodes, which, as a whole, contains three categories: Background tasks: the most important one is called Offload Worker, which is responsible for offloading expensive compaction tasks and flushing data to S3 storage. SQL compute nodes: responsible for executing SQL requests, here divided into write nodes and read nodes. The former also provides the ability to read the freshest data. Stream task processing node: responsible for executing stream processing requests. Log(Reliability) Layer As MatrixOne's Single Source of Truth, data is considered as persistently stored in MatrixOne once it is written into the Log Layer. It is built upon our world-class expertise in the Replicated State Machine model to guarantee state-of-the-art high throughput, high availability, and strong consistency for our data. Following a fully modular and disaggregated design by itself, it is also the central component that helps to decouple the storage and compute layers. This in turn earns our architecture much higher elasticity when compared with traditional NewSQL architecture. Storage Layer The storage layer transforms the incoming data from the Log Layer into an efficient form for future processing and storage. This includes cache maintenance for fast accessing data that has already been written to S3. In MatrixOne, TAE (Transactional Analytic Engine) is the primary interface exposed by the Storage Layer, which can support both row and columnar storage together with transaction capabilities. Besides, the Storage Layer includes other internally used storage capabilities as well, e.g. the intermediate storage for streaming. Storage Provision Layer As an infrastructure agnostic DBMS, MatrixOne stores data in shared storage of S3 / HDFS, or local disks, on-premise servers, hybrid, and any cloud, or even smart devices. The Storage Provision Layer hides such complexity from upper layers by just presenting them with a unified interface for accessing such diversified storage resources. MatrixOne System Components In MatrixOne, to achieve the integration of distributed and multi-engine, a variety of different system components are built to complete the functions of the architecture-related layers: File Service File Service is the component of MatrixOne responsible for reading and writing all storage media. Storage media include memory, disk, object storage, and so on., which provide the following features: File Service provides a unified interface so that reading and writing of different media can use the same interface. The design of the interface follows the concept of immutable data. After the file is written, no further updates are allowed. The update of the data is realized by generating a new file. This design simplifies operations such as data caching, migration, and verification and is conducive to improving the concurrency of data operations. Based on a unified read-write interface, File Service provides a hierarchical cache and a flexible cache strategy to balance read-write speed and capacity. Log Service Log Service is a component specially used to process transaction logs in MatrixOne, and it has the following features: The Raft protocol ensures consistency, and multiple copies are used to ensure availability. Save and process all transaction logs in MatrixOne, ensure that Log Service logs are read and written typically before the transaction is committed, and check and replay the log content when the instance is restarted. After the transaction is submitted and placed, truncate the content of the Log Service to control the size of the Log Service. The content that remains in the Log Service after truncation is called Logtail. If multiple Log Service copies are down at the same time, the entire MatrixOne will be down. Database Node The database node (DN) is the carrier used to run MatrixOne's distributed storage engine TAE, which provides the following features: Manage metadata information in MatrixOne and transaction log content saved in Log Service. Receive distributed transaction requests sent by Computing Node (CN), adjudicate the read and write requests of distributed transactions, push transaction adjudication results to CN, and push transaction content to Log Service to ensure the ACID characteristics of transactions. Generate a snapshot according to the checkpoint in the transaction to ensure the snapshot isolation of the transaction, and release the snapshot information after the transaction ends. Computing Node The computing node (CN) is a component of Matrixone that accesses user requests and processes SQL. The toolkit includes the following modules: Frontend, it handles the client SQL protocol, accepts the client's message, parses it to get the executable SQL of MatrixOne, calls other modules to execute the SQL, organizes the query results into a message, and returns it to the client. Plan, parse the SQL processed by Frontend, generate a logical execution plan based on MatrixOne's calculation engine and send it to Pipeline. Pipeline, which parses the logical plan, converts the logical plan into an actual execution plan and then runs the execution plan through Pipeline. Disttae, responsible for specific read and write tasks, including synchronizing Logtail from DN and reading data from S3, and sending the written data to DN. Stream Engine The streaming engine is a new component to ease the ETL process from OLTP to OLAP. It is planned in the MatrixOne roadmap but not implemented yet. Proxy The Proxy component is a powerful tool mainly used for load balancing and SQL routing. It has the following functions: Through SQL routing, resource isolation between different accounts is realized, ensuring that the CNs of different accounts will not affect each other. Through SQL routing, users can do a second split in the resource group of the same account, improving resource utilization. The load balancing between different CNs is realized in the second split resource group, making the system more stable and efficient.

The high cost-performance of MatrixOne is mainly reflected in the following aspects: Single Cluster Supports Mixed Load HTAP With the rapid popularization and diversified development of big data applications, traditional data processing solutions are increasingly unable to meet the demand for real-time analysis of massive data. Modern data application requirements tend to consider both high-concurrent OLTP transactional business and large-scale data OLAP analytical business simultaneously. MatrixOne is specifically designed to solve the problem of mixed loads. MatrixOne can support OLTP and OLAP in the same cluster, achieving Hybrid Transaction and Analytical Processing (HTAP). Users no longer need to build two separate database systems for OLTP and OLAP, a single database can support mixed loads. This avoids the cost of building and maintaining two systems and the ETL process of synchronizing data from the OLTP system to the OLAP system. Users can easily handle business and analysis in the same cluster. Single Storage Engine Achieves HTAP In databases, achieving HTAP usually requires encapsulating an OLTP engine and an OLAP engine into a single database product. Although the conversion process between the two storage engines is hidden from the user, who only sees a unified SQL interface, the data is stored twice, once in each machine, and the cost of hardware and storage is not reduced. Different from the engine mentioned above encapsulation method, MatrixOne achieves HTAP using a single storage engine. As shown below, MatrixOne achieves single-engine HTAP by grouping other computing nodes (CN) and distinguishing between load-running links. When a user's application request enters the MatrixOne cluster, the Proxy module distributes OLAP-like requests to the CN group designed explicitly for OLAP. These requests usually need to read or write data on a large scale and interact directly with object storage via the CN nodes. For OLTP-like requests, such as small amounts of INSERT , UPDATE , and DELETE , these go through another group of CN designed explicitly for OLTP, and the DN nodes handle transaction information and write shared logs to LogService. DN also constantly compresses and merges small transactional data from LogService and writes them back to object storage. In summary, the data written into MatrixOne by users only exists once and is processed by a single storage engine, significantly reducing the cost of storage and computing hardware. Flexible Resource Allocation Increases Utilization The system primarily serves transactional business based on CRUD in actual data application business scenarios. However, at specific points in time, such as at night, at the end of the month, or at the end of the year, it is necessary to analyze the overall data over a period of time. At this time, if the user only has one database system, they will need to temporarily reduce the business load or conduct OLAP analytical tasks when the business load is low. However, in such cases, there are often problems like long analysis time and cannot affect the long running time of business. If users deploy a separate database system for OLAP analytical business, the actual analytical business is often difficult to maximize, leading to a specific waste of resources. As introduced in the previous section, MatrixOne achieves HTAP by grouping stateless computing nodes and supporting OLTP and OLAP business at the underlying layer through different links. This architecture allows MatrixOne to adjust resources flexibly. Allocation according to actual business needs increases machine utilization and achieves true cost-effectiveness. When CRUD-type business requirements are high, you can allocate more CN nodes to OLTP. In addition, when analytical business requirements increase, you can give more CN nodes to OLAP. These adjustments are fully dynamic and configurable. Take the following diagram as an example; suppose that the user needs 3 computing nodes to handle OLTP business and 3 computing nodes to handle OLAP business. And these hardware resources are fully bound, i.e., nodes serving OLTP cannot provide services for OLAP and vice versa. Moreover, users' planning for machine resources often exceeds the upper limit of actual demand. However, the time to reach the total peak demand is quite limited in real business. If you plan to use the MatrixOne cluster to support these businesses, you can adjust to 4 computing nodes; typically, 3 nodes handle OLTP business, and 1 node takes OLAP business. Then, at the end of the month or other periods when the demand for analysis is high, you can adjust to 1 computing node to handle the OLTP business and 3 computing nodes to run the OLAP business; after the peak period, you can return to the original configuration, thereby improving machine resource utilization by 40%. Efficient and Low-Cost Object Storage At the storage level, MatrixOne mainly uses object storage. This storage uses the principle of erasure coding and only needs a redundancy as low as 33% to ensure the high availability of data. Compared with the standard method of providing high availability through multiple copies, erasure coding has a higher space utilization rate under the same reliability. In the MatrixOne cluster, take the minimum configuration recommended by the official Minio for private deployment (4 nodes \u00d7 4 disks) as an example; MatrixOne can support at least 4 disks as erasure coding disks and 12 disks as data disk architecture, with redundancy of 1.33. In addition, object storage also supports low-cost storage media such as HDD disks. In usage scenarios where the demand for cluster computing performance is not high, and storage is the main focus, it can further reduce the usage cost. Compatibility with MySQL MatrixOne maintains compatibility with MySQL, the most popular open-source database on the market, regarding syntax, protocol, and ecological tools. This allows users familiar with MySQL or who have used MySQL to migrate and learn at a meager cost.

The separation of the storage, data, and computing layers enables MatrixOne to flexibly realize node expansion when encountering system resource bottlenecks. At the same time, resources can be allocated more efficiently under the multi-node architecture, avoiding hotspots and resource requisition to a certain extent. Transactions and Isolation In MatrixOne, transactions are isolated using optimistic transactions and snapshots. Optimistic transactions can achieve better performance in a distributed architecture with fewer conflicts. At the same time, snapshot isolation with a higher isolation level can be achieved in terms of implementation. In order to ensure the ACID four elements of the transaction, MatrixOne currently supports and only supports one snapshot isolation level. Compared with the ordinary read-committed isolation level, this is stricter, which can effectively prevent dirty reads and better adapt to distributed optimistic transactions. Cloud Native MatrixOne is a cloud-native database. From the storage layer, it adapts to various storage methods such as local disks, AWS S3, and NFS and realizes non-aware management of multiple types of storage through File service. MatrixOne clusters can run stably in a variety of infrastructure environments, can adapt to private enterprise clouds, and provide services in different public cloud vendor environments. Load Balancing Under the distributed database architecture, load differences inevitably exist between different nodes, which may lead to performance bottlenecks in specific business scenarios or idle computing resources. Therefore, to ensure that other nodes are kept as close as possible in resource allocation, MatrixOne implements the load-balancing function of computing resources. SQL Routing SQL routing is often used in early sub-database and sub-table database scenarios. It determines which instance/library/table to send the request to according to the data distribution after receiving an SQL request. In MatrixOne, although the capacity of the storage engine no longer limits the size of the database, under the multi-CN architecture, there are still scenarios for load balancing between multiple CNs and resource isolation between different accounts. Therefore, in MatrixOne, SQL routing is implemented to send SQL requests to other CN nodes for execution according to predefined rules. This solves the situation that a database instance cannot load many data access requirements. Allowlist Allowlist is a security policy that controls access to restricted resources, systems, or networks. It is based on a core idea that only authorized and trusted entities are allowed to access, while other unauthorized access attempts are denied. These authorized entities may include specific users, IP addresses, programs, or others. The opposite of an allowlist is a blocklist, a policy that specifies a list of prohibited entities that will be prevented from accessing a restricted resource, system, or network. Under the blocklist policy, entities outside the blocklist can access. The allowlist has the following characteristics: Only users or systems on the pre-defined list are allowed to access; other users or systems not included in the allowlist are denied access. Using an allowlist policy can improve security but may limit access for legitimate users. Therefore, a trade-off exists between security and user convenience when implementing an allowlist policy. In the database system, the allowlist is mainly used to restrict user access, only allowing specific users to access the database of a particular server or network segment, thereby improving the security of the database. Multi-Account The multi-account mode of a single cluster can provide benefits such as resource sharing, simplified management, improved scalability, and security isolation. It is precious for scenarios needing database services for multiple accounts simultaneously. MatrixOne's multi-account mode can provide independent database instances for different accounts and adopts a logical isolation method to ensure the security and independence of each account's data, effectively preventing the risk of data leakage and tampering. MatrixOne Key Performance Efficient Storage MatrixOne chooses AWS S3 as an efficient storage solution, meeting the two core requirements of low cost and hot-cold data separation. Its reliable availability ensures low risk in public clouds and provides a compatible version for private deployment. Low cost: Reducing redundancy to achieve lower costs with acceptable performance. Hot-cold data separation: A necessary condition for fine-grained data management. Clear Transaction Division of Labor CN is responsible for all calculations and transaction logic, while DN is responsible for storing metadata, log information, and transaction adjudication. The Logtail object is introduced in the logs to save associated data from recent logs. Logtail data is regularly written to S3. When CN scales out, Logtail data can be synchronized to the cache in real-time to achieve partial data sharing. Set a threshold for transaction size. Transactions that exceed the threshold are directly written to S3 and logs only record write records. Transactions that do not exceed the threshold are still written by DN, significantly increasing throughput. HTAP Workload Isolation As an HTAP database, it achieves isolation of different types of workloads: Server-level isolation: When hardware resources are sufficient, each component runs on a different physical machine and accesses the same object storage. Container-level isolation: When hardware resources are limited, the stateless nature of all nodes is utilized, and containers are used as isolation measures for each node. Flexible Resource Allocation As an HTAP database, the ratio of different business scenarios constantly changes, and there are higher requirements for resource allocation. The resource allocation pattern under the old architecture is doomed to be unable to achieve flexible adjustment, and more refined management of each node is needed, including but not limited to the following: CN node division of labor: Users can divide CN for TP or AP business. When a business resource bottleneck occurs, CN is horizontally scaled out. Dynamically judge the workload of different business CN groups and automatically allocate idle resources to busy groups. Complete isolation of analytical resources is achieved through the logical concept of accounts (accounts). Different accounts can use specified CN resources in a dedicated or shared manner.","title":"MatrixOne Features Overview"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/feature-overview/#matrixone-features-overview","text":"","title":"MatrixOne Features Overview"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/feature-overview/#features","text":"In MatrixOne, it has the following features to make you more efficient in the process of using MatrixOne:","title":"Features"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/feature-overview/#distributed-architecture","text":"In MatrixOne, the distributed storage and computing separation architecture is adopted.

MatrixOne is a highly available distributed database that can meet enterprise demands. This document aims to introduce the high availability features of MatrixOne, including critical functions such as fault recovery, data redundancy, load balancing, and so on. Business Requirements The business demands high database availability mainly reflect the following aspects: Continuous Availability : Enterprises need to ensure the continuous operation of their critical business databases to prevent long-term system interruptions or unavailability of services, thus ensuring business continuity and user satisfaction. Fault Recovery : When a database failure occurs, it should quickly and automatically perform fault detection and switch to reduce the system downtime, ensuring the continuity and reliability of the service. Data Protection and Recovery : Data is a vital enterprise asset, so regular database backups are needed, and quick data recovery is required to cope with accidental data loss or damage. Cross-Regional Disaster Recovery : For critical businesses, it may be necessary to set up data centers in different geographical regions, implementing cross-regional disaster recovery to cope with natural disasters, network interruptions, or regional faults. Advantages MatrixOne uses erasure coding for data redundancy checks and synchronizes transaction logs using the Raft protocol. Only when a majority of nodes write successfully can the transaction be committed, ensuring the strong consistency of data and availability even when a minority of replicas fail. MatrixOne's high availability meets the level 4 standard in the finance industry (RPO=0, RTO<30min). Architecture The overall technical architecture of MatrixOne is shown in the figure below. We will introduce their high availability according to different component modules. Resource Scheduling Layer The technical architecture of MatrixOne is completely cloud-native. All technical components run on Kubernetes in a containerized form. The Kubernetes cluster can ensure continuous availability by adopting a multi-master and multi-slave deployment scheme. Specific deployment topology and system can refer to the Kubernetes official scheme . Storage Layer MatrixOne uses object storage in the storage layer and recommends deploying with Minio. MinIO, as a mature distributed object storage solution, needs to ensure the high availability of data services and the completeness and consistency of data files. The architecture of the MinIO cluster is distributed, storing data on multiple nodes, and providing high availability and fault tolerance. At the same time, the MinIO cluster uses Erasure Coding technology to ensure the reliability and availability of data. When a node fails, other nodes can use these coded replicas to recover lost data. Shared Logs The shared log component LogService is the only component in MatrixOne that holds distributed transaction status. This is a three-node architecture following the Raft protocol. Even if one node fails, it can still work typically. It is responsible for ensuring the final consistency of services for the entire MatrixOne cluster. Transaction Layer The transaction layer component Data Node is responsible for conflict detection and arbitration of transaction operations. It is a stateless node. If a failure occurs, Kubernetes can pull it up at any time, and it can generally recover in seconds, ensuring continuous availability. The current 0.8 version of Data Node only supports single-node operation, and subsequent versions will add multiple Data Node schemes to improve availability further. Computation Layer The computation layer component Compute Node is responsible for parsing front-end Queries, generating, and executing execution plans. It is also a stateless node. If a failure occurs, Kubernetes can pull it up at any time and generally recover in seconds, ensuring continuous availability. Proxy The Proxy component in the resource scheduling layer is responsible for grouping computation nodes CN to achieve load isolation and implement user connection level load balancing within the CN group.

With its decoupled architecture for storage and transaction computations, MatrixOne can support online transactions and real-time statistical analysis in the same data engine while providing an efficient resource isolation mechanism. This design dramatically preserves data freshness, eliminating the need for building real-time data warehouses in many business scenarios, thus helping customers realize their business value. Business Requirements With the expansion of business scale, the continuous growth of data volume, and the increasing complexity of business systems, traditional online databases have to face the issue of splitting. However, the architecture after splitting cannot meet some needs for associated statistics and real-time analysis. At this time, products like real-time data warehouses come into play. However, due to the complex architecture and high cost of real-time data warehouses, not all enterprises can build a complete ecological link. MatrixOne's HTAP mode was born in response to this situation. It can use one engine to support high concurrent online throughput while providing real-time online analysis capability for massive data. This provides momentum for enterprises to improve efficiency and continuous innovation. Advantages One-stop experience : Satisfy all the needs for transaction processing (TP) and analytical processing (AP) within a single database, and users can enjoy a one-stop experience covering all TP and AP scenarios. Simplified integration work : Users using MatrixOne only need to do a small amount of integration work to achieve extensive use of TP and AP scenarios, especially significantly reducing the complex ETL work from TP database synchronization to AP database. Cost-effective : MatrixOne uses a single storage engine to implement HTAP; compared with traditional multi-engine solutions, users only need to maintain a set of clusters and store one set of data, which can significantly reduce hardware investment. Architecture MatrixOne implements HTAP through modular storage, calculation, transaction architecture, a multi-level storage system, and load processing link isolation mode. Modular Separation of Storage, Computation, and Transaction The overall technical architecture of MatrixOne adopts a separate architecture of storage and computation. The modular design separates the database's computation, storage, and transaction processing into independent modules, thus forming a database system with independent scalability for each component. As shown in the following figure, MatrixOne is composed of three independent layers: Computation layer , with Compute Node as the unit, realizes serverless computation and transaction processing. It has its Cache, supporting random restarts and scaling; multiple Compute Nodes can calculate parallel to improve query efficiency. Transaction layer , composed of Database Node and Log Service, provides complete log service and metadata information, with built-in Logtail for storing recently written new data. Storage layer , all data are saved in object storage represented by S3, which achieves low-cost, infinitely expandable storage method. Through a unified file operation service named File Service, it realizes the invisible operation of different nodes on the underlying storage. Multi-level Storage System As illustrated in the previous section, the storage system of MatrixOne is composed of shared storage for all data, a small number of shared logs, and a stateless cache on the computing nodes. All data are stored in object storage, the primary storage for the entire database and the only location for data persistence. Object storage has the characteristics of being low-cost and nearly infinitely scalable. The LogService provides shared log services for saving state information of transactions such as writes/updates across the entire cluster. It is the only component in the entire cluster with a state. Therefore, LogService must ensure high availability through three nodes using the distributed Raft protocol. However, it only retains transaction logs for a certain period, which we call Longtail. After some time, there will be DN to help compress historical logs and store them in S3. Therefore, Logtail can maintain a very slim data size, generally a few GB. Each computing node CN has a cache. When a user queries for the first time, it will read related data from object storage and put it into the cache as hot data. When the customer queries the same content again, if the cache is hit, the query result will be returned to the user quickly. The technical feature of cold and hot data separation brought by the cache can refer to Detailed Explanation of Data Caching and Cold-Hot Data Separation Architecture . In addition to reading data from object storage, CN nodes will also subscribe to Logtail data from LogService, and new updates in LogService will be pushed to CN immediately. Load Processing Link Isolation Custom Load Isolation User requests first enter the MatrixOne cluster and go through the Proxy module. Proxy is a module used to implement the grouping and isolation of computing nodes. This module groups computing nodes CN into several groups through configuration and uses tags to distinguish various tenants or loads, allowing users to set different CN groups to handle other businesses according to different business needs. For specific operations of Proxy using CN groups, refer to Manage CN Groups Using Proxy . Isolation of TP/AP Load Links At the execution level, MatrixOne will route it to different processing links according to the request type, thus realizing the isolation of OLTP and OLAP. Below we will explain how to implement load isolation based on the processing methods of read and write requests. Write Request Processing As shown in the figure, when processing write requests (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE): CN node will start a transaction and check whether there are primary key conflicts or other transaction-related issues in the write request. If so, it will return an error to the user directly. Next, CN will decide on the operation link based on the data size of the write request. If the data size does not exceed the set threshold (usually 10MB), the CN node will send the data to the DN node. The DN node will perform operations like write conflict detection and transaction arbitration. After confirming no mistakes, these data will be written into LogService as logs to form Longtail. The updated Logtail will be immediately pushed to the CN nodes that have subscribed to Logtail data for queries. If the data size exceeds the threshold, the CN node will directly write the data into object storage and send the commit information to DN. The DN node will perform operations like write conflict detection and transaction arbitration. After confirming no errors, the transaction will be committed. From the figure above, it is known that small data volume OLTP-type write requests will go through the processing link from CN to DN and then to LogService, while large data volume write requests, such as Load, etc., will mainly go through CN to S3, and a small amount from CN to DN. Read Request Processing As shown in the figure, the CN node will first check the subscribed Logtail data when handling read requests. If the data directly hits Logtail, it is in the latest part of the written data and can be directly returned. If it does not hit Logtail, CN will check its cache and other visible CNs. If it hits the cache, it will directly return the result. If it does not hit the cache, CN will judge whether a large amount of data needs to be read through the execution plan. Multiple CN nodes will read in parallel from the object storage if it exceeds a certain threshold (such as 200 block sizes). A single CN node will read from object storage if it does not exceed the threshold. As shown above, OLTP and OLAP read requests will go through the processing link from CN to S3. Through the isolation of CN nodes by Proxy, further isolation of CN can be achieved. Scenarios Whether in finance, telecommunications, manufacturing, or emerging industries like the internet and technology, HTAP has many application scenarios. For example, in the financial field, HTAP databases can meet the needs of high-speed transaction processing and real-time risk management, support high throughput and low latency requirements of financial transactions, and provide real-time data analysis functions to support decision-making and risk monitoring. In the telecommunications industry, HTAP databases can be used for real-time billing and network optimization. They can handle much real-time data, track user communication and network activities, and support real-time analysis and intelligent decision-making to improve service quality, network performance, and user experience. In the Internet of Things field, HTAP databases can be used for device management and real-time monitoring. They can handle many sensor data and device status information and provide real-time device monitoring and management functions. This is significant for real-time decision-making, remote fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance of IoT systems.

In this design, account (Account) is a logical concept as a unit of resource allocation and database management. MatrixOne's multi-account mode can provide independent database instances for different accounts and adopts an analytical isolation method to ensure the security and independence of each account's data, effectively preventing the risk of data leakage and tampering. Business Requirements As an enterprise's business scales up and data volume continues to grow, alongside the increase in business departments or project teams, the enterprise can perform flexible tenant management according to its individual business needs and scale. This satisfies the independence requirements of different business departments or project teams. Under the multi-tenant mode of MatrixOne, enterprises can easily manage the data resources of each tenant, making the business processes such as data analysis and reporting smoother and more accurate. At the same time, this approach also helps the enterprise improve business efficiency, reduce management costs, and maximize enterprise resource utilization. Advantages Reduce operating costs : Multiple users can share a database cluster, avoiding deploying and managing multiple sets of clusters, thereby reducing the investment cost of hardware and software. Resource and load isolation : The multi-account mode improves data security and reliability, and the data and load of different users are isolated from each other. Even if a user's data has problems or the load is too high, it will not affect other users. Dynamic Resource Allocation : multi-account can also improve the scalability of the database. Each account can expand or shrink its resources independently and maximize resource usage in the face of different load levels. account Unified Management : Although each account is isolated and operates independently, administrators can still manage other accounts through the system account, such as quickly creating new accounts and deleting old accounts in batches. account data sharing : Data sharing between accounts is required in specific federal statistical query scenarios. MatrixOne provides a complete account data sharing and subscription mechanism to meet the more flexible business analysis needs. Cross-Regional Deployment : When some services span many regions, accounts must associate with areas to provide nearby services. MatrixOne supports different accounts under the same cluster to be distributed in other areas to serve the business nearby. Architecture The MatrixOne system contains two accounts: system (sys) and common accounts. The system account is built into the MatrixOne cluster, and the system will log in to this account by default after the cluster starts. The primary responsibilities of this account include: Store and manage system tables related to the cluster. Manage cluster-level functions, such as creating/deleting accounts, modifying system configuration, etc. In contrast, common accounts are created by system accounts. A common account can be regarded as a database instance, and the account name needs to be specified to connect. Common accounts have the following characteristics: Possibility to create your user. Can create databases, tables, and all other objects. Have independent information_schema and other system databases. Has independent system variables. Possess other characteristics that a database instance should have. Multi-account resource isolation MatrixOne's distributed cluster adopts a Proxy module and CN resource group technology architecture to realize multi-account resource isolation. When a user connects, the connection will pass through the Proxy module. The Proxy will forward the connection to a CN in the corresponding CN resource group according to the account label information of the CN and select the CN with the lightest load according to the principle of load balancing. In the MatrixOne cluster architecture, CNs are deployed in containers, so CNs are isolated. A CN resource group a account, uses is a set of CNs tagged with the account. If resources are insufficient and need to be expanded, the CN resource group can be expanded horizontally to meet the demand without preempting the resources of other CN resource groups. The architecture diagram is as follows: Scenarios The multi-account capability of MatrixOne can show advantages in the following application scenarios. Multi-account SaaS Multi-account model design is critical in a SaaS application that serves many enterprise customers. Traditional architecture Traditional multi-account architectures store and manage data for each account at the database level. There are usually multiple design patterns, such as a shared database pattern (each account shares a database but has its data tables/columns) or an independent database pattern (each account has its database). Both traditional models have specific challenges: The account-shared database mode relies on the application layer to distinguish account logic by SQL and application layer code, and the isolation degree of data and resources is low. It is straightforward to seize the resources of other accounts when the load of a account suddenly increases significantly, resulting in a decline in the entire system's performance. However, only one set of database clusters is used in the account-shared database mode. The resource cost and operation and maintenance management difficulty are relatively low, and the upgrade/expansion/application change only needs to be done once to complete the global change. The account-independent database mode supports each account with an independent database instance. The isolation of resources and data is very high, but resource costs and O&M difficulties are increased. Unifying upgrades and other operation and maintenance actions will be very time-consuming when accounts exceed one hundred. MatrixOne Architecture The multi-account capability of MatrixOne brings a new architectural approach. accounts still share a MatrixOne cluster, and unified account O&M and management can be performed through system accounts. In addition, the isolation of data and resources is realized through the built-in multi-account capability. Each account can independently expand and contract resources, further reducing the difficulty of operation and maintenance. This approach meets not only the requirements for isolation but also the requirements for low resource and operation and maintenance costs. Multi-account mode Data isolation degree Resource cost Resource isolation Operation and maintenance complexity account Shared Database Mode Low Low Low Low account Independent Database Mode High High High High MatrixOne Mode High Low High Low Microservice Application Architecture Microservice application architecture is a software architectural pattern that implements an application by developing small services. Each small service typically runs in its process and communicates via a lightweight HTTP API. These services are usually bounded by business modules, which can be developed, deployed independently, and released using automated deployment tools. A microservices approach can help businesses launch new products and services faster, aligning development teams with business goals. Unlike SaaS applications, microservice applications also face the problem of database sharing or independence. It is usually recommended to prepare a separate database for each microservice; this pattern is more suitable for microservice architecture because each service is developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Other services will not be affected when there is a need to upgrade or change the data schema. When a service needs to be expanded, the service can also be partially developed. In addition, if some services require unique database capabilities, such as Elastic Search or vector search, etc., this mode provides more flexible possibilities. However, microservices ultimately serve the same business, and data must be shared between different services, so they will also encounter the same dilemma as SaaS application multi-account. The multi-account capability provided by MatrixOne can well balance these two contradictions, which can not only ensure the independence of data and resource expansion of each microservice but also maintain a certain degree of sharing. Group Subsidiaries/Business Units Many group companies separate operations with regional subsidiaries or business units, which often operate independently, with total production, sales, and technical support teams, and use their IT systems. However, the group company needs to fully grasp the business status of the subsidiaries, so the subsidiaries need to report a large amount of business data regularly. This IT architecture faces precisely the same problem in terms of database design as the previous two scenarios, namely the trade-off between sharing and isolation. In addition, geographical location also needs to be considered in this scenario. Subsidiaries usually have their regional attributes and need to provide services nearby. For example, manufacturing companies are generally located in big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, but various factories may be scattered in second-and third-tier cities. These factories need to cooperate closely with systems such as ERP and MES. Therefore, these systems often need to be deployed locally in the factory, and the headquarters needs to grasp the situation of each factory, so these systems need to report data to the group company. The traditional deployment architecture usually adopts the method of independently deploying databases, while the application layer implements data synchronization and reporting. The multi-account capability of MatrixOne can well solve the database sharing/isolation dilemma. Since the CN nodes required by the accounts can be deployed to the nearest location of the subsidiary company, a cluster can be naturally formed with other components of the group company under the condition of network connectivity, which is not only convenient for localized business use, but also meets the requirements of efficient data reporting and statistics need.

At the same time, this approach also helps the enterprise improve business efficiency, reduce management costs, and maximize enterprise resource utilization.","title":"Business Requirements"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/key-feature-multi-accounts/#advantages","text":"Reduce operating costs : Multiple users can share a database cluster, avoiding deploying and managing multiple sets of clusters, thereby reducing the investment cost of hardware and software. Resource and load isolation : The multi-account mode improves data security and reliability, and the data and load of different users are isolated from each other. Even if a user's data has problems or the load is too high, it will not affect other users. Dynamic Resource Allocation : multi-account can also improve the scalability of the database. Each account can expand or shrink its resources independently and maximize resource usage in the face of different load levels. account Unified Management : Although each account is isolated and operates independently, administrators can still manage other accounts through the system account, such as quickly creating new accounts and deleting old accounts in batches. account data sharing : Data sharing between accounts is required in specific federal statistical query scenarios. MatrixOne provides a complete account data sharing and subscription mechanism to meet the more flexible business analysis needs. Cross-Regional Deployment : When some services span many regions, accounts must associate with areas to provide nearby services. MatrixOne supports different accounts under the same cluster to be distributed in other areas to serve the business nearby.","title":"Advantages"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/key-feature-multi-accounts/#architecture","text":"The MatrixOne system contains two accounts: system (sys) and common accounts. The system account is built into the MatrixOne cluster, and the system will log in to this account by default after the cluster starts. The primary responsibilities of this account include: Store and manage system tables related to the cluster. Manage cluster-level functions, such as creating/deleting accounts, modifying system configuration, etc. In contrast, common accounts are created by system accounts. A common account can be regarded as a database instance, and the account name needs to be specified to connect. Common accounts have the following characteristics: Possibility to create your user. Can create databases, tables, and all other objects. Have independent information_schema and other system databases. Has independent system variables.

The Proxy will forward the connection to a CN in the corresponding CN resource group according to the account label information of the CN and select the CN with the lightest load according to the principle of load balancing. In the MatrixOne cluster architecture, CNs are deployed in containers, so CNs are isolated. A CN resource group a account, uses is a set of CNs tagged with the account. If resources are insufficient and need to be expanded, the CN resource group can be expanded horizontally to meet the demand without preempting the resources of other CN resource groups.

There are usually multiple design patterns, such as a shared database pattern (each account shares a database but has its data tables/columns) or an independent database pattern (each account has its database). Both traditional models have specific challenges: The account-shared database mode relies on the application layer to distinguish account logic by SQL and application layer code, and the isolation degree of data and resources is low. It is straightforward to seize the resources of other accounts when the load of a account suddenly increases significantly, resulting in a decline in the entire system's performance. However, only one set of database clusters is used in the account-shared database mode. The resource cost and operation and maintenance management difficulty are relatively low, and the upgrade/expansion/application change only needs to be done once to complete the global change. The account-independent database mode supports each account with an independent database instance. The isolation of resources and data is very high, but resource costs and O&M difficulties are increased. Unifying upgrades and other operation and maintenance actions will be very time-consuming when accounts exceed one hundred.","title":"Traditional architecture"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/key-feature-multi-accounts/#matrixone-architecture","text":"The multi-account capability of MatrixOne brings a new architectural approach. accounts still share a MatrixOne cluster, and unified account O&M and management can be performed through system accounts.

Each small service typically runs in its process and communicates via a lightweight HTTP API. These services are usually bounded by business modules, which can be developed, deployed independently, and released using automated deployment tools. A microservices approach can help businesses launch new products and services faster, aligning development teams with business goals. Unlike SaaS applications, microservice applications also face the problem of database sharing or independence. It is usually recommended to prepare a separate database for each microservice; this pattern is more suitable for microservice architecture because each service is developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Other services will not be affected when there is a need to upgrade or change the data schema. When a service needs to be expanded, the service can also be partially developed. In addition, if some services require unique database capabilities, such as Elastic Search or vector search, etc., this mode provides more flexible possibilities. However, microservices ultimately serve the same business, and data must be shared between different services, so they will also encounter the same dilemma as SaaS application multi-account. The multi-account capability provided by MatrixOne can well balance these two contradictions, which can not only ensure the independence of data and resource expansion of each microservice but also maintain a certain degree of sharing.","title":"Microservice Application Architecture"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/key-feature-multi-accounts/#group-subsidiariesbusiness-units","text":"Many group companies separate operations with regional subsidiaries or business units, which often operate independently, with total production, sales, and technical support teams, and use their IT systems. However, the group company needs to fully grasp the business status of the subsidiaries, so the subsidiaries need to report a large amount of business data regularly. This IT architecture faces precisely the same problem in terms of database design as the previous two scenarios, namely the trade-off between sharing and isolation. In addition, geographical location also needs to be considered in this scenario. Subsidiaries usually have their regional attributes and need to provide services nearby. For example, manufacturing companies are generally located in big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, but various factories may be scattered in second-and third-tier cities. These factories need to cooperate closely with systems such as ERP and MES. Therefore, these systems often need to be deployed locally in the factory, and the headquarters needs to grasp the situation of each factory, so these systems need to report data to the group company. The traditional deployment architecture usually adopts the method of independently deploying databases, while the application layer implements data synchronization and reporting. The multi-account capability of MatrixOne can well solve the database sharing/isolation dilemma. Since the CN nodes required by the accounts can be deployed to the nearest location of the subsidiary company, a cluster can be naturally formed with other components of the group company under the condition of network connectivity, which is not only convenient for localized business use, but also meets the requirements of efficient data reporting and statistics need.","title":"Group Subsidiaries/Business Units"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/key-feature-multi-accounts/#reference","text":"For more information on multi-account, see: Multi-Account Application Scenario Quick Start: Create accounts, Verify Resource Isolation","title":"Reference"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/mysql-compatibility/","text":"MySQL Compatibility This documentation primarily introduces the compatibility comparison information between the MySQL mode of MatrixOne database and the native MySQL database.

Its structure is based on a storage, computing, and transaction separation architecture, which boasts impressive elastic scalability that quickly adapts to user workload changes. As data volumes and businesses expand, enterprises' demand for database scalability is ever-increasing. Generally, whether user data grows from 0 to 100TB or concurrent operations increase from several hundred to hundreds of thousands, MatrixOne can meet performance demands through its unparalleled scalability. Business Requirements The demand for database scalability in enterprises primarily originates from the following pain points: Growth in Data Volume : With business development, an enterprise's data volume will continue to grow. Suppose the scalability of the database could be better. In that case, it might not be able to effectively process a large amount of data, leading to a decline in query speed and affecting the regular operation of the business. Increase in Concurrent Requests : As the number of users grows, the number of concurrent requests a database needs to handle also increases. Suppose the scalability of the database could be better. In that case, it might not effectively process many concurrent requests, leading to an extension in response time and affecting the user experience. Change in Business Needs : The business needs of an enterprise may change over time. Suppose the scalability of the database could be better. In that case, it might be unable to flexibly adapt to these changes, causing the enterprise to invest more resources to adjust and optimize the database. System Availability : If the scalability of the database could be better, it might not effectively handle hardware or network failures, resulting in lower system availability, which affects business continuity. If a database has good scalability, it can help enterprises improve data processing capabilities, thus effectively coping with the growth of data volume, handling the increase in concurrent requests, and ensuring system availability. Architecture MatrixOne adopts a comprehensive cloud-native architecture. All components exist in the form of containers and are uniformly managed by Kubernetes. Kubernetes itself has strong container orchestration and management capabilities. In MatrixOne, the manual expansion only requires modifying the Kubernetes configuration. Advantages From the technical architecture perspective, the unparalleled scalability of MatrixOne mainly manifests in the following aspects: Flexible Expansion of Distributed Architecture : MatrixOne adopts a storage and computing-separated architecture. The separation of the storage, transaction, and computing layers allows MatrixOne to expand nodes when encountering system resource bottlenecks flexibly. The storage layer is mainly based on object storage and partly based on the cache on the computing nodes (CN). The transaction layer is based on stateless transaction nodes (DN). The computing layer is based on stateless computing nodes (CN). The multi-node architecture can more effectively distribute resources and avoid hot spots and resource contention. Infinite Expansion Capability of S3 Object Storage : The core storage of MatrixOne is completely based on S3 object storage. S3 object storage has naturally high availability and infinite scalability, making MatrixOne highly scalable in data storage. No matter how the data scale grows, MatrixOne can meet the demand by expanding S3 storage. In a private deployment environment, MatrixOne builds S3 services based on the open-source MinIO component. MatrixOne can seamlessly utilize the object storage service provided by the public cloud in a public cloud environment. Stateless Computing and Transaction Nodes : MatrixOne's computing nodes (CN) and transaction nodes (DN) are stateless, meaning they can be horizontally expanded anytime. Stateless design means that computing and transaction nodes do not need to store any persistent data They can be easily added or deleted to cope with different load requirements. This design makes MatrixOne extremely scalable and flexible when dealing with large-scale concurrent requests. (The current 0.8 version DN node does not yet have expansion capabilities, but the DN mainly handles transaction submission information, and the load is lower, so a single DN is enough to take a large-scale cluster, and subsequent versions will improve DN's scalability.) Independent Expansion of Different Loads and Accounts : MatrixOne can manage multiple computing nodes (CN) into groups through the Proxy module to form a CN Set and implement independent expansion of each CN Set through tags. Users can assign different CN Sets to accounts, allowing load isolation and independent expansion between accounts. Different CN Sets can also be specified for different loads, such as read and write or transactional and analytical loads, to achieve their isolation and independent expansion.","title":"Scalability"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/scalability/#scalability","text":"MatrixOne is a superior integration of heterogeneous cloud-native databases. Its structure is based on a storage, computing, and transaction separation architecture, which boasts impressive elastic scalability that quickly adapts to user workload changes. As data volumes and businesses expand, enterprises' demand for database scalability is ever-increasing. Generally, whether user data grows from 0 to 100TB or concurrent operations increase from several hundred to hundreds of thousands, MatrixOne can meet performance demands through its unparalleled scalability.","title":"Scalability"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/scalability/#business-requirements","text":"The demand for database scalability in enterprises primarily originates from the following pain points: Growth in Data Volume : With business development, an enterprise's data volume will continue to grow. Suppose the scalability of the database could be better. In that case, it might not be able to effectively process a large amount of data, leading to a decline in query speed and affecting the regular operation of the business. Increase in Concurrent Requests : As the number of users grows, the number of concurrent requests a database needs to handle also increases. Suppose the scalability of the database could be better. In that case, it might not effectively process many concurrent requests, leading to an extension in response time and affecting the user experience. Change in Business Needs : The business needs of an enterprise may change over time. Suppose the scalability of the database could be better. In that case, it might be unable to flexibly adapt to these changes, causing the enterprise to invest more resources to adjust and optimize the database. System Availability : If the scalability of the database could be better, it might not effectively handle hardware or network failures, resulting in lower system availability, which affects business continuity. If a database has good scalability, it can help enterprises improve data processing capabilities, thus effectively coping with the growth of data volume, handling the increase in concurrent requests, and ensuring system availability.","title":"Business Requirements"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/scalability/#architecture","text":"MatrixOne adopts a comprehensive cloud-native architecture.

Several standard performance tuning methods include: Index optimization: Indexes can speed up queries and improve database performance. By using the correct index type, selecting the right index columns, avoiding excessive indexing, and regularly rebuilding indexes, you can maximize the use of indexes to improve performance. Query optimization: By optimizing the structure of queries, avoiding unnecessary subqueries, using more efficient JOIN statements, and avoiding using OR operators, you can reduce the time and resources required for queries. Table structure optimization: Optimizing table structure, such as selecting the correct data types, avoiding NULL values, using appropriate constraints and default values, normalization, and denormalization, can reduce storage space and query time. Data volume control: By limiting the amount of data returned, paging, caching, using stored procedures, and other methods, you can reduce the time and resources required for queries. Server configuration optimization: By increasing server memory, adjusting database parameters, regularly cleaning logs and caches, and other methods, you can improve database performance and response time. Monitoring and debugging: Using database performance monitoring tools, debugging SQL queries, viewing database logs and error messages, and other methods can help identify and resolve performance issues. It should be noted that SQL performance tuning is a complex process that requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as database structure, data volume, and query patterns. Continuous testing and validation of optimization results are also necessary to ultimately improve database performance and response time. When executing SQL statements in MatrixOne, the system automatically plans and selects the optimal execution plan rather than simply querying according to the SQL statements. Currently, MatrixOne supports performance tuning through EXPLAIN interpretation of the execution plan and optimizing the physical arrangement of tables.

The Hint hint command tells the query optimizer how to execute the query statement. By using hints, you can provide queries with information about how to access data to improve query performance. The Hint hint directive often tunes large or complex queries. Hints can be used to modify the execution plan of a query, including choosing a different index, using a different JOIN algorithm, changing the join order, etc. Hints in SQL use comment syntax, and specific comments can be added to query statements to specify hints. Syntax {DELETE|INSERT|SELECT|UPDATE} /*+ hint [text] [hint[text]]... */ Explanations DELETE , INSERT , SELECT , UPDATE are keywords of SQL statements. /*+ */ is a comment symbol in the SQL statement. hint is the specific instruction for hinting. text is the argument to the prompt command. Here are some commonly used SQL hints: /*+ INDEX (table index) */ : Specifies to use a specific index to execute the query. /*+ FULL (table) */ : Specifies to perform a full table scan instead of using an index. Scenarios When the query optimizer chooses an inappropriate execution plan, you can use the hint hint to specify a better execution plan. For example, when a query involves multiple tables, the optimizer may choose the wrong join algorithm or join order, resulting in degraded query performance. In this case, hints can be used to specify a better join algorithm or join order. When a query contains complex subqueries or aggregate functions, the hint hint can be used to optimize the execution plan of the query. Because the optimizer cannot analyze complex subqueries or aggregate functions, it may choose the wrong execution plan, resulting in degraded query performance. When the amount of data accessed by the query is vast, the hint hint can be used to optimize the query execution plan. In this case, hints can be used to specify the use of a specific index or join algorithm to improve query performance. MatrixOne supports the use of hint hints to choose between full table scans or index scans and to optimize the order of multi-table joins. Select full table scan or use index scan: An index scan can speed up queries, but in some cases, a full table scan might be faster than an index scan. For example, using indexes can become slow when query conditions are too broad. In this case, the following hint syntax can be used to choose to use a full table scan or an index scan: SELECT /*+ INDEX(table_name index_name) */ column_name FROM table_name WHERE ... Among them, table_name is the table name, index_name is the index name, and column_name is the column name. If an index name is specified, the query will scan that index. The query will use a full table scan if no index name is specified. Optimize the order of multi-table joins: When a query involves multiple tables, the query optimizer will try to choose the optimal join order. However, in some cases, the optimizer may be unable to select the optimal join order, resulting in degraded query performance. In this case, the following hint syntax can be used to optimize the order of multi-table joins: SELECT /*+ ORDERED */ column_name FROM table1 , table2 WHERE table1 . column1 = table2 . column2 ; Among them, ORDERED specifies that the query should be connected in the order of the tables, that is, connect table1 first and then join table2. This prevents the optimizer from choosing the wrong join order, improving query performance. Example -- Create a new table called orders CREATE TABLE order ( order_id INT PRIMARY KEY , customer_id INT , order_date DATE , order_total DECIMAL ( 10 , 2 ) ); -- insert datas INSERT INTO order ( order_id , customer_id , order_date , order_total ) VALUES ( 1 , 101 , '2022-05-10' , 100 . 00 ), ( 2 , 102 , '2022-05-09' , 150 . 00 ), ( 3 , 103 , '2022-05-08' , 200 . 00 ), ( 4 , 104 , '2022-05-07' , 50 . 00 ); -- Query all orders of a customer and sort them in descending order by order date SELECT order_id , order_date , order_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 ORDER BY order_date DESC ; To optimize this query, we can use the following hint hints: -- Execute the query using an index called idx_customer_id created on the customer_id field SELECT /*+ INDEX(orders idx_customer_id) */ order_id , order_date , order_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 ORDER BY order_date DESC ; Constraints Currently /*+ HINT_NAME(t1, t2) */ only implements the syntax, and cannot control the execution plan for now.","title":"Optimizer Hints"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/control-execution-plan/optimizer-hints/#optimizer-hints","text":"When you determine the problems in the execution plan, such as when the optimizer chooses a query plan that is not optimal, you can use Optimizer Hints to control the generation of the execution plan.

Execution plan is the specific steps for the database to execute SQL statements, such as accessing data in the table through index or full table scan, connection query implementation method and connection sequence, etc.; the execution plan is based on The details of your tables, columns, indexes, and conditions in the WHERE clause can tell you how the query will be executed or how it has been executed, which can be performed without reading all rows. Huge Queries of tables; joins involving multiple tables can be performed without comparing every combination of rows. . If the performance of a SQL statement is not satisfactory, the first thing you should look at is its execution plan. Like most mature database products, MatrixOne database also provides the function of analyzing query statement performance. The MatrixOne query optimizer selects the most efficient execution plan by \"calculating\" the input SQL statement, and this execution plan is the execution plan. Use EXPLAIN to query the execution plan The EXPLAIN statement shows the MatrixOne query execution plan for the SQL statement. EXPLAIN works with SELECT , DELETE , INSERT , REPLACE , and UPDATE statements. When EXPLAIN is used with an explainable statement, MatrixOne displays information from the optimizer about the statement execution plan. That is, MatrixOne explains how it would process the statement, including information about how tables are joined and in which order. Note When you use the MatrixOne client to connect to MatrixOne, to read the output result in a clearer way without line wrapping, you can use the pager less -S command. Then, after the EXPLAIN result is output, you can press the right arrow \u2192 button on your keyboard to horizontally scroll through the output. EXPLAIN Example You can see the EXPLAIN example to understand the query execution plan: Data preparation : CREATE TABLE t ( id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY auto_increment , a INT NOT NULL , pad1 VARCHAR ( 255 ), INDEX ( a )); INSERT INTO t VALUES ( 1 , 1 , 'aaa' ),( 2 , 2 , 'bbb' ); EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 1 ; Return result : + ------------------------------------------------+ | QUERY PLAN | + ------------------------------------------------+ | Project | | -> Table Scan on aab . t | | Filter Cond : ( CAST ( t . a AS BIGINT ) = 1 ) | + ------------------------------------------------+ EXPLAIN does not execute the actual query. EXPLAIN ANALYZE can be used to execute the query and show EXPLAIN information. This can be useful in diagnosing cases where the execution plan selected is suboptimal. EXPLAIN output analysis QUERY PLAN: the name of an operator. Filter Cond:Filter conditions Table Scan:scans the table Project is the parent node of the executive order in the query process. The structure of the Project is tree-like, and the child node \"flows into\" the parent node after the calculation is completed. The parent, child, and sibling nodes may execute parts of the query in parallel. Range query In the WHERE/HAVING/ON conditions, the MatrixOne optimizer analyzes the result returned by the primary key query.

This document describes some of these optimizations for common subqueries and how to interpret the output of EXPLAIN . From the execution of SQL statements, subquery generally has the following two types: Self-contained Subquery : In a database nested query, the inner query is entirely independent of the outer query. For example: select * from t1 where t1.id in (select t2.id from t2 where t2.id>=3); , the execution sequence is as follows: Execute the inner query first: (select t2.id from t2 where t2.id>=3) . The result of the inner query is carried into the outer layer, and then the outer query is executed. Correlated Subquery : In Correlated Subquery nested in databases, the inner and outer queries would not be independent, and the inner queries would depend on the outer queries. For example: SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM t2 WHERE t1.ti = t2.ti and t2.id>=4); , generally, the execution sequence is as follows: Queries a record from the outer query: SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id . Put the queried records into the inner query, then put the records that meet the conditions into the outer query. Repeat the above steps. However, MatrixOne will rewrite the SQL statement as an equivalent JOIN statement: select t1.* from t1 join t2 on t1.id=t2.id where t2.id>=4; Example We have prepared a simple example to help you understand the execution plan for interpreting the SUBQUERY using EXPLAIN . > drop table if exists t1 ; > create table t1 ( id int , ti tinyint unsigned , si smallint , bi bigint unsigned , fl float , dl double , de decimal , ch char ( 20 ), vch varchar ( 20 ), dd date , dt datetime ); > insert into t1 values ( 1 , 1 , 4 , 3 , 1113 . 32 , 111332 , 1113 . 32 , 'hello' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 2 , 2 , 5 , 2 , 2252 . 05 , 225205 , 2252 . 05 , 'bye' , 'sub query' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 3 , 6 , 6 , 3 , 3663 . 21 , 366321 , 3663 . 21 , 'hi' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 4 , 7 , 1 , 5 , 4715 . 22 , 471522 , 4715 . 22 , 'good morning' , 'my subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 5 , 1 , 2 , 6 , 51 . 26 , 5126 , 51 . 26 , 'byebye' , ' is subquery?' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 6 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 632 . 1 , 6321 , 632 . 11 , 'good night' , 'maybe subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 7 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 7443 . 11 , 744311 , 7443 . 11 , 'yes' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 8 , 7 , 5 , 8 , 8758 . 00 , 875800 , 8758 . 11 , 'nice to meet' , 'just subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t1 values ( 9 , 8 , 4 , 9 , 9849 . 312 , 9849312 , 9849 . 312 , 'see you' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > drop table if exists t2 ; > create table t2 ( id int , ti tinyint unsigned , si smallint , bi bigint unsigned , fl float , dl double , de decimal , ch char ( 20 ), vch varchar ( 20 ), dd date , dt datetime ); > insert into t2 values ( 1 , 1 , 4 , 3 , 1113 . 32 , 111332 , 1113 . 32 , 'hello' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 2 , 2 , 5 , 2 , 2252 . 05 , 225205 , 2252 . 05 , 'bye' , 'sub query' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 3 , 6 , 6 , 3 , 3663 . 21 , 366321 , 3663 . 21 , 'hi' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 4 , 7 , 1 , 5 , 4715 . 22 , 471522 , 4715 . 22 , 'good morning' , 'my subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 5 , 1 , 2 , 6 , 51 . 26 , 5126 , 51 . 26 , 'byebye' , ' is subquery?' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 6 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 632 . 1 , 6321 , 632 . 11 , 'good night' , 'maybe subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 7 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 7443 . 11 , 744311 , 7443 . 11 , 'yes' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 8 , 7 , 5 , 8 , 8758 . 00 , 875800 , 8758 . 11 , 'nice to meet' , 'just subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); > insert into t2 values ( 9 , 8 , 4 , 9 , 9849 . 312 , 9849312 , 9849 . 312 , 'see you' , 'subquery' , '2022-04-28' , '2022-04-28 22:40:11' ); Self-contained Subquery > select * from t1 where t1 . id in ( select t2 . id from t2 where t2 . id >= 3 ); + ------+------+------+------+----------+---------+------+--------------+----------------+------------+---------------------+ | id | ti | si | bi | fl | dl | de | ch | vch | dd | dt | + ------+------+------+------+----------+---------+------+--------------+----------------+------------+---------------------+ | 3 | 6 | 6 | 3 | 3663 . 21 | 366321 | 3663 | hi | subquery | 2022 - 04 - 28 | 2022 - 04 - 28 22 : 40 : 11 | | 4 | 7 | 1 | 5 | 4715 . 22 | 471522 | 4715 | good morning | my subquery | 2022 - 04 - 28 | 2022 - 04 - 28 22 : 40 : 11 | | 5 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 51 . 26 | 5126 | 51 | byebye | is subquery ?

What is EXPLAIN ANALYZE EXPLAIN ANALYZE is a profiling tool for your queries that will show you where SQL spends time on your query and why. It will plan the query, instrument it and execute it while counting rows and measuring time spent at various points in the execution plan. When execution finishes, EXPLAIN ANALYZE will print the plan and the measurements instead of the query result. n addition to the query plan and estimated costs, which a normal EXPLAIN will print, EXPLAIN ANALYZE also prints the actual costs of individual iterators in the execution plan. How to use EXPLAIN ANALYZE? With the above example, to get the actual execution time, you can either execute the query or use EXPLAIN ANALYZE : > explain analyze select count ( * ) from a where a >= 2 and a <= 8 ; + -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | QUERY PLAN | + -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Project | | Analyze : timeConsumed = 0 us inputRows = 1 outputRows = 1 inputSize = 8 bytes outputSize = 8 bytes memorySize = 8 bytes | | -> Aggregate | | Analyze : timeConsumed = 3317 us inputRows = 2 outputRows = 2 inputSize = 8 bytes outputSize = 16 bytes memorySize = 16 bytes | | Aggregate Functions : starcount ( 1 ) | | -> Table Scan on aab . a | | Analyze : timeConsumed = 6643 us inputRows = 31 outputRows = 24 inputSize = 96 bytes outputSize = 64 bytes memorySize = 64 bytes | | Filter Cond : ( CAST ( a . a AS BIGINT ) >= 2 ), ( CAST ( a . a AS BIGINT ) <= 8 ) | + -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 8 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) Judging from the printed execution results, when performing aggregate calculations and scanning tables respectively, the following measurements are obtained, which can be used as reference items: total time consumed: timeConsumed inputRows/outputRows inputSize/outputSize memorySize With this information, you can analyze queries and understand why they behave the way they do, which can be explored in the following ways: How long do these queries take to execute? You'll be able to view the timeConsumed . Why execute the current query plan instead of other execution plans? You can look at the row counter.

One of the smallest MatrixOne distributed cluster architectures is shown in the following figure: CN mainly performs the user's query request. Therefore, the resource size of the CN node is proportional to the computing power. The most direct expansion method is to expand the resources of a single CN node vertically. At the same time, the queried data is stored in the CN cache as hot data. If the cache is hit, the query can be returned directly from the cache without obtaining cold data from the object store. After the upper capacity limit is exceeded, the cache will only replace the data with the LRU algorithm, so the cache size is also helpful for improving performance.

This article explains how to use Cluster by for performance tuning. What is Cluster by ? Cluster by is a command used to optimize the physical arrangement of a table. When Cluster by is used during table creation, tables without primary keys can be physically sorted according to a specified column. The data rows will be rearranged in the same order as the values of that column. This physical sorting helps improve query performance. The following are some considerations when using Cluster by : Cluster by cannot coexist with a primary key because the primary key already specifies the sorting order. Otherwise, it will result in a syntax error. Cluster by can only be specified during table creation and does not support dynamic creation. The syntax for using Cluster by is as follows: Single column syntax: create table() cluster by col; Multi-column syntax: create table() cluster by (col1, col2); How to use Cluster by for performance tuning? The steps for using Cluster by for performance tuning are as follows: Determine the column to be sorted. First, it is necessary to determine the column to be sorted. Generally, columns that are frequently used for filtering can be selected. For example, if there is an order table, the orders can be sorted by time. The time column is a commonly used sorting column for data with time series characteristics. Execute the Cluster by command. Once the sorting column is determined, the Cluster by command can be executed during table creation to perform the sorting. Here is an example: create table t1 ( a int , b int , c varchar ( 10 )) cluster by ( a , b , c ); desc t1 ; + -------+-------------+------+------+---------+-------+---------+ | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | Comment | + -------+-------------+------+------+---------+-------+---------+ | a | INT ( 32 ) | YES | | NULL | | | | b | INT ( 32 ) | YES | | NULL | | | | c | VARCHAR ( 10 ) | YES | | NULL | | | + -------+-------------+------+------+---------+-------+---------+ 3 rows in set ( 0 . 02 sec ) In this example, we first create a table named t1. Then, we use the Cluster by command to physically sort the table according to columns a, b, and c. This way, all data rows will be arranged in the order of values of columns a, b, and c. How to Make the Best Use of Cluster by for Performance Tuning? There are two ways to make the best use of Cluster by for performance tuning: Put the most frequently queried columns at the front. In the case of Cluster by with multiple columns, the first column will get the best query acceleration effect because the data distribution of the first column is ultimately ordered. Only when the first column is the same the remaining data will be sorted according to the second column. Therefore, the query acceleration effect of the second column is weaker than that of the first column, and the subsequent columns will decrease. Consequently, it is generally not recommended to specify too many columns in Cluster by ; usually, 3-4 columns are sufficient. Put low cardinality columns at the front. Cardinality refers to the number of different values in a column. For example, gender, with only two values, is a typical low cardinality column. For example, ID card numbers are usually not duplicated, which is a high cardinality column. If the tall cardinality column is placed in the first column of Cluster by , the data distribution of the whole table has been thoroughly sorted on the first column, which leads to the subsequent columns not being effective. In this case, it is recommended to use Cluster by for a single column or to build a separate index for the high cardinality column rather than including it in Cluster by . To consider when using Cluster by Cluster by may take a long time to complete on large tables It may take a long time to complete when using Cluster by on a large table. This is because the operation requires reorganizing, reordering, and storing the data in the table. Therefore, when executing the Cluster by command, the table size and hardware configuration need to be considered. Cluster by may affect the performance of insert and update operations Using Cluster by to sort data in a table physically may affect the performance of insert and update operations. When specific columns sort the data in a table, insert and update procedures may need to move many rows. Therefore, this impact must be considered when using Cluster by . Cluster by needs to be regularly executed to maintain performance As data grows and changes, the physical sorting of data in a table may lose its effectiveness. Therefore, the Cluster by command needs to be regularly executed to ensure that the physical sorting of data remains effective. It is important to note that using the Cluster by command needs to be carefully considered. It is recommended first to validate its effects in a testing environment to avoid negative impacts on the data in the table.","title":"Using Cluster by for performance tuning"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/optimization-concepts/through-cluster-by/#using-cluster-by-for-performance-tuning","text":"Cluster by is a commonly used performance-tuning technique that can help optimize the execution efficiency of queries.

Then, we use the Cluster by command to physically sort the table according to columns a, b, and c. This way, all data rows will be arranged in the order of values of columns a, b, and c.","title":"How to use Cluster by for performance tuning?"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/optimization-concepts/through-cluster-by/#how-to-make-the-best-use-of-cluster-by-for-performance-tuning","text":"There are two ways to make the best use of Cluster by for performance tuning: Put the most frequently queried columns at the front. In the case of Cluster by with multiple columns, the first column will get the best query acceleration effect because the data distribution of the first column is ultimately ordered. Only when the first column is the same the remaining data will be sorted according to the second column. Therefore, the query acceleration effect of the second column is weaker than that of the first column, and the subsequent columns will decrease. Consequently, it is generally not recommended to specify too many columns in Cluster by ; usually, 3-4 columns are sufficient. Put low cardinality columns at the front. Cardinality refers to the number of different values in a column. For example, gender, with only two values, is a typical low cardinality column. For example, ID card numbers are usually not duplicated, which is a high cardinality column. If the tall cardinality column is placed in the first column of Cluster by , the data distribution of the whole table has been thoroughly sorted on the first column, which leads to the subsequent columns not being effective. In this case, it is recommended to use Cluster by for a single column or to build a separate index for the high cardinality column rather than including it in Cluster by .","title":"How to Make the Best Use of Cluster by for Performance Tuning?"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/optimization-concepts/through-cluster-by/#to-consider-when-using-cluster-by","text":"Cluster by may take a long time to complete on large tables It may take a long time to complete when using Cluster by on a large table.

A partitioned table organizes data in a database, which involves dividing the table data into multiple partitions. Each partition acts as an independent sub-table. In MatrixOne, table data is divided into different storage objects based on the key values of one or more table columns. These key values are referred to as data partitions or ranges. A data partition or range is a subset of table rows stored separately from other row sets. The table data is divided into multiple data partitions or ranges based on the specifications provided in the PARTITION BY clause of the CREATE TABLE statement. Partitioned tables can bring many benefits, such as faster query speed, optimized data maintenance, and increased availability. Partitioned tables simplify the reading and writing of table data. When SQL is executed on a partitioned table, the system first determines which partition the data belongs to and then reads or writes only that partition, avoiding operations on all the data in the table. Scenarios for Partitioned Tables Improving query performance by scanning only a portion of the table. Improving write performance by inserting, updating, or deleting only a portion of the table data. Batch deleting data within a specific range rather than performing an entire table operation. Fine-tuning and managing data. What Performance Tuning can be done with Partitioned Tables? Query performance tuning : Using partitioned tables can make queries more efficient by targeting specific partitions, thus improving query efficiency. For example, if a table is partitioned by date, specific data within a certain date range can be queried without scanning the entire table. Storage Space Usage Performance Tuning : Partitioned tables can better manage table data and reduce unnecessary storage space usage. For example, if a table is partitioned by time, old partitions can be quickly deleted or archived without affecting data in other partitions. Impact of Partitioned Tables on Performance Typically, as data increases within a table, performance gradually decreases. However, if the same data is stored in partitioned tables, data access can be optimized by partitioning data into different storage objects based on different ranges. Compared to full table access, the optimized access method will prioritize accessing specific partitions, making it possible for requests for data addition, deletion, and modification to be more effectively distributed to different partitions, avoiding the occurrence of IO hotspots and ultimately achieving better performance improvements. How to Use Partitioned Tables for Tuning When using partitioned tables, the following prerequisites need to be considered: The table has a large amount of data distributed according to some rules, such as by year or month. Improved query performance is desired by scanning only a portion of the table. Frequent data reads, and writes are limited to a specific range, while other fields have a lower frequency of reads and write. Frequent data reads and writes typically have certain fixed filtering conditions. Choosing the Partition Key The partition key is a key factor in physically dividing the table, and choosing the right partition key can significantly improve read and write performance. When selecting a partition key, the following factors need to be considered: High cardinality: A partition key with high cardinality will result in better data distribution and scalability. For example, for a table with student gender and age attributes, age has a higher cardinality than gender and is more suitable as the partition key. Uniqueness: The partition key should be as unique as possible to avoid a partition becoming a standalone hotspot. Using a composite key can achieve uniqueness. For example, in a company, if more than half of the employees in different departments are in the same city, partitioning the town as the partition key will result in that department becoming a hotspot. However, using a composite key such as department ID + city ID can significantly reduce the probability of a hot partition. Establishing Partitioning Strategy Even if a column with high cardinality and uniqueness is selected as the partitioning key, hotspot partitions may still occur if the partitioning range is inappropriate. Therefore, more sophisticated management is required in the partitioning strategy. Data distribution should be as evenly as possible to avoid extreme distribution. For example, if student age is used as the partitioning key, the company's age distribution needs to be evaluated to prevent overly concentrated age ranges in a partition. For instance, a school may have many students aged 18-22 but relatively few under 18 or over 22, so each age can be partitioned. Add a random number to disperse the partition. Combine the partitioning key with a random number sequence in high-concurrency write scenarios. For example, in an order system, the number of orders for a particular item is very high. A random number sequence can be added when designing the table, with a value range of 1-10, and used as the partitioning key with the item type. Each time an order is written, a number from 1 to 10 is randomly generated, and these orders are randomly written to 10 partitions, reducing the likelihood of hotspot partitions. MatrixOne Partitioned Table Types In MatrixOne, multiple partitioning modes are supported for tables, each corresponding to a different partitioning method. Range Partition Range partitioning is a partitioning method based on continuous values. The partitioning key can be an integer type, DATE, or DATETIME in date type. Partitions must not overlap, and the partition definition uses the VALUES LESS THAN operator. Example The following two tables use an integer column and a date column as partitioning keys, respectively: CREATE TABLE members ( firstname VARCHAR ( 25 ) NOT NULL , lastname VARCHAR ( 25 ) NOT NULL , username VARCHAR ( 16 ) NOT NULL , email VARCHAR ( 35 ), joined DATE NOT NULL ) PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS ( joined ) ( PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1960-01-01' ), PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1970-01-01' ), PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1980-01-01' ), PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1990-01-01' ), PARTITION MySQL :: MySQL 8 . 0 Reference Manual :: 13 . 1 . 20 CREATE TABLE Statement ) PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS ( joined ) ( PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1960-01-01' ), PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1970-01-01' ), PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1980-01-01' ), PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN ( '1990-01-01' ) ); Note that if the value of the partition column in the data being inserted or updated does not correspond to a partition, the corresponding insert or update operation will fail. For example, if you insert a row with a \"joined\" date of 2000-01-01 but no corresponding partition, the process will fail because the partition cannot be located. So, when performing insert or update operations, you must ensure that the value of the partition column belongs to the corresponding partition. List Partition List partitioning requires each partition to be composed of a defined value list, and each partition member in the list cannot have duplicate values. List partitioning can only use an integer type as the partition key. Example CREATE TABLE employees ( id INT NOT NULL , fname VARCHAR ( 30 ), lname VARCHAR ( 30 ), hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01' , separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31' , job_code INT , store_id INT ) PARTITION BY LIST ( store_id ) ( PARTITION pNorth VALUES IN ( 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 17 ), PARTITION pEast VALUES IN ( 1 , 2 , 10 , 11 , 19 , 20 ), PARTITION pWest VALUES IN ( 4 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 18 ), PARTITION pCentral VALUES IN ( 7 , 8 , 15 , 16 ) ); Please note that if the value of the partitioning column in the data being inserted or updated does not correspond to any partition, the insertion will fail. Hash Partition Hash partitioning is commonly used to distribute data among different partitions evenly. Common types of hash partitioning include HASH function partitioning and KEY function partitioning. In HASH function partitioning, the column or expression used for partitioning must be explicitly specified, and its type must be an integer. It is also recommended to explicitly specify the number of partitions, which must be a positive integer. Example CREATE TABLE employees ( id INT NOT NULL , fname VARCHAR ( 30 ), lname VARCHAR ( 30 ), hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01' , separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31' , job_code INT , store_id INT ) PARTITION BY HASH ( YEAR ( hired ) ) PARTITIONS 4 ; Unlike HASH function partitioning, KEY function partitioning supports all types of partition keys except for large object types (TEXT/BLOB), and it is unnecessary to specify the number of partitions. When using KEY function partitioning, the database service provides its hashing method, so explicitly defining the number of partitions is unnecessary. For example, the following statement can be used to create a table with a partition key of s1: CREATE TABLE tm1 ( s1 CHAR ( 32 ) PRIMARY KEY ) PARTITION BY KEY ( s1 ); It should be noted that if the partition key is the table's primary key column, the system will default to using the primary key column as the partition key if it is not explicitly specified. For example: CREATE TABLE tm1 ( s1 CHAR ( 32 ) PRIMARY KEY ) PARTITION BY KEY (); Composite Partition Composite partitioning is a variant of range partitioning and list partitioning that allows combinations of multiple columns in the partition key. Depending on the type of partition key, composite partitioning can be divided into range and list composite partitioning. The types that can be used in composite partitioning include: All integer types, including [UNSIGNED] SMALLINT/INT/BIGINT Data types, including DATE and DATETIME Character types, including CHAR, VARCHAR, BINARY, and VARBINARY. Range composite partitioning allows multiple types of columns to be combined, such as: CREATE TABLE rcx ( a INT , b INT , c CHAR ( 3 ), d date ) PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS ( a , d , c ) ( PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ( 5 , '2022-01-01' , 'ggg' ), PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ( 10 , '2012-01-01' , 'mmm' ), PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ( 15 , '2002-01-01' , 'sss' ), PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN ( MAXVALUE , MAXVALUE , MAXVALUE ) ); List composite partitions allow users to define partitions in the same way that multiple columns can be combined, such as: CREATE TABLE t1 ( a INT , b int , c date ) PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS ( a , floor ( b ), c ) ( PARTITION p0 VALUES IN ( ( 0 , 0 , NULL ), ( NULL , NULL , NULL ) ), PARTITION p1 VALUES IN ( ( 0 , 1 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 0 , 2 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 0 , 3 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 1 , 1 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 1 , 2 , '2000-01-01' ) ), PARTITION p2 VALUES IN ( ( 1 , 0 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 2 , 0 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 2 , 1 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 3 , 0 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 3 , 1 , '2000-01-01' ) ), PARTITION p3 VALUES IN ( ( 1 , 3 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 2 , 2 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 2 , 3 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 3 , 2 , '2000-01-01' ), ( 3 , 3 , '2000-01-01' ) ) ); Constraints The partition table does not support the following partitions for the time being: Range partition: Only supports integer and date (date/datetime). List partition: Only supports integers. Hash partition: The HASH function only supports integers . Composite partition: Only supports integers, dates, and strings. The partition table cannot be used for acceleration for now.","title":"Performance Tuning with Partitioned Tables"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/optimization-concepts/through-partition-by/#performance-tuning-with-partitioned-tables","text":"","title":"Performance Tuning with Partitioned Tables"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/optimization-concepts/through-partition-by/#what-is-a-partitioned-table","text":"A partitioned table organizes data in a database, which involves dividing the table data into multiple partitions.

It can define a type with discrete values, with each enumeration constant representing a specific value. The \"ENUM\" data type is suitable for storing data with limited fixed values, such as status and identification. The advantages of the \"ENUM\" data type are: Improved readability of column values. Compact data storage. When storing \"ENUM\" in MatrixOne, only the numerical index (1, 2, 3, ...) corresponding to the enumeration value is stored. Syntax ENUM ('value1', 'value2', ..., 'valuen') For example, to define an ENUM column, you can use the following syntax: CREATE TABLE table_name ( ... col ENUM ( 'value1' , 'value2' , 'value3' ), ... ); Explanations ENUM is a keyword used to declare an enumeration type. value1 to valuen is the optional list of choices for this ENUM type. The value of a column using the ENUM type can only be one of the values listed above. Enumeration values can be of type string, int, or time. Note: You can have multiple enumeration values in the ENUM data type. However, it is recommended to keep the number of enumeration values below 20. Example Explanation The value of an ENUM type must be selected from a predefined list of values. The following example will help you understand: CREATE TABLE enumtable ( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , color ENUM ( 'red' , 'green' , 'blue' ), PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ); The above statement will create a table named enumtable , which contains an enum type field named color . The value of the color field must be one of red , green , or blue . At the same time, according to the order of column definition, the indexes of red , green , and blue are 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Insert ENUM values When inserting data into a field of an enumeration type, only predefined enumeration values \u200b\u200bor NULL can be inserted. An error is raised if the inserted value is not in the predefined list. For example: INSERT INTO enumtable ( id , color ) VALUES ( '01' , 'red' ); -- 'red' is in the predefined list; the insertion was successful INSERT INTO enumtable ( id , color ) VALUES ( '02' , 'yellow' ); -- 'yellow' is not in the predefined list, an error will be generated INSERT INTO enumtable ( id , color ) VALUES ( '03' , NULL ); -- The enumeration member does not define not null; the insertion is successful In addition to enumeration values, data can be inserted into ENUM columns using numeric indexes on enumeration members. For example: INSERT INTO enumtable ( id , color ) VALUES ( '04' , 2 ); -- Since the index of `green` is 2, this data is successfully inserted NON-NULL CONSTRAINT FOR ENUM RESTRICTIONS If we defined the color column NOT NULL when creating the table: CREATE TABLE enumtable ( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , color ENUM ( 'red' , 'green' , 'blue' ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ); When inserting a new row without specifying a value for the color column, MatrixOne will use the first enumeration member as the default value: INSERT INTO enumtable ( id ) VALUES ( '05' ); -- Here, the first enumeration member `red` will be assigned as the default value for the column with id 05 Filter ENUM values When querying data, you can use enumeration constants or integer values \u200b\u200bto filter data. For example: SELECT * FROM enumtable WHERE color = 'green' ; SELECT * FROM enumtable WHERE color = 2 ; -- 'green' comes second in the predefined list and corresponds to an integer value of 2 Sort ENUM values MatrixOne sorts ENUM values \u200b\u200bby index number. Therefore, the order of enumeration members depends on how they are defined in the enumeration list. It should be noted that type ENUM values are represented internally in SQL as integer values, not string values. So when you execute a query, if you use an integer value to filter data, you must match it with the integer value of the enum constant.

The precision represents the number of significant digits that are stored for values, and the scale represents the number of digits that can be stored following the decimal point. Standard SQL requires that DECIMAL(5,2) be able to store any value with five digits and two decimals, so values that can be stored in the salary column range from -999.99 to 999.99. In MatrixOne, the syntax DECIMAL(M) is equivalent to DECIMAL(M,0). Similarly, the syntax DECIMAL is equivalent to DECIMAL(M,0), where the implementation is permitted to decide the value of M. MatrixOne supports both of these variant forms of DECIMAL syntax. The default value of M is 10. If the scale is 0, DECIMAL values contain no decimal point or fractional part. In MatrixOne, the maximum number of digits for DECIMAL is 38, but the actual range for a given DECIMAL column can be constrained by the precision or scale for a given column. When such a column is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than are permitted by the specified scale, the value is converted to that scale. DECIMAL Data Type Characteristics This section discusses the characteristics of the DECIMAL data type (and its synonyms), with particular regard to the following topics: Maximum number of digits Storage format The declaration syntax for a DECIMAL column is DECIMAL(M,D). The ranges of values for the arguments are as follows: M is the maximum number of digits (the precision). It has a range of 1 to 38. D is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point (the scale). It has a range of 1 to 38 and must be no larger than M. If D is omitted, the default is 0. If M is omitted, the default is 10. The maximum value of 38 for M means that calculations on DECIMAL values are accurate up to 38 digits. Values for DECIMAL columns are stored using a binary format that packs decimal digits into 8 bytes or 16 bytes. The storage required for remaining digits is given by the following table.

The JSON data type provides these advantages over storing JSON-format strings in a string column: Automatic validation of JSON documents stored in JSON columns. Invalid documents produce an error. Automatically optimize storage format. JSON documents stored in JSON columns are converted to an internal format that permits quick read access to document elements. When the server later must read a JSON value stored in this binary format, the value need not be parsed from a text representation. The binary format is structured to enable the server to look up subobjects or nested values directly by key or array index without reading all values before or after them in the document. The space required to store a JSON document is roughly the same as for BLOB or TEXT . JSON Types JSON types contain JSON array and JSON object. A JSON array contains a list of values separated by commas and enclosed within [ and ] characters: [\"abc\", 10, null, true, false] A JSON object contains a set of key-value pairs separated by commas and enclosed within { and } characters: {\"k1\": \"value\", \"k2\": 10} As the examples illustrate, JSON arrays and objects can contain scalar values that are strings or numbers, the JSON null literal, or the JSON boolean true or false literals.

If UNIX_TIMESTAMP() is called with a date argument, it returns the value of the argument as seconds since '1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC. The server interprets date as a value in the session time zone and converts it to an internal Unix timestamp value in UTC. If you pass an out-of-range date to UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), it returns 0. If date is NULL , it returns NULL . The return value is an integer if no argument is given or the argument does not include a fractional seconds part, or DECIMAL if an argument is given that includes a fractional seconds part. Syntax > UNIX_TIMESTAMP([date]) Arguments Arguments Description date Optional. The date/datetime to extract the date from. The date argument may be a DATE, DATETIME, or TIMESTAMP string, or a number in YYMMDD, YYMMDDhhmmss, YYYYMMDD, or YYYYMMDDhhmmss format. If the argument includes a time part, it may optionally include a fractional seconds part. When the date argument is a TIMESTAMP column, UNIX_TIMESTAMP() returns the internal timestamp value directly, with no implicit string-to-Unix-timestamp conversion. Convert between non-UTC time zone and Unix timestamp values If you use UNIX_TIMESTAMP() and FROM_UNIXTIME() to convert between values in a non-UTC time zone and Unix timestamp values, the conversion is lossy because the mapping is not one-to-one in both directions. For example, due to conventions for local time zone changes such as Daylight Saving Time (DST), it is possible for UNIX_TIMESTAMP() to map two values that are distinct in a non-UTC time zone to the same Unix timestamp value. FROM_UNIXTIME() maps that value back to only one of the original values.

Path expressions are useful with functions that extract parts of or modify a JSON document, to specify where within that document to operate. For example, the following query extracts from a JSON document the value of the member with the name key: mysql > SELECT JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"id\": 14, \"name\": \"Aztalan\"}' , '$.name' ); + ---------------------------------------------------------+ | JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"id\": 14, \"name\": \"Aztalan\"}' , '$.name' ) | + ---------------------------------------------------------+ | \"Aztalan\" | + ---------------------------------------------------------+ Path syntax uses a leading $ character to represent the JSON document under consideration, optionally followed by selectors that indicate successively more specific parts of the document: A period followed by a key name names the member in an object with the given key. The key name must be specified within double quotation marks if the name without quotes is not legal within path expressions (for example, if it contains a space). [N] appended to a path that selects an array names the value at position N within the array. Array positions are integers beginning with zero. If the array is negative, an error is generated. Paths can contain * or ** wildcards: .[*] evaluates to the values of all members in a JSON object. [*] evaluates to the values of all elements in a JSON array. prefix**suffix evaluates to all paths that begin with the named prefix and end with the named suffix. A path that does not exist in the document (evaluates to nonexistent data) evaluates to NULL. Example : [3, {\"a\": [5, 6], \"b\": 10}, [99, 100]] $[0] evaluates to 3. $[1] evaluates to {\"a\": [5, 6], \"b\": 10}. $[2] evaluates to [99, 100]. $[3] evaluates to NULL (it refers to the fourth array element, which does not exist). Because $[1] and $[2] evaluate to nonscalar values, they can be used as the basis for more-specific path expressions that select nested values. Examples: $[1].a evaluates to [5, 6]. $[1].a[1] evaluates to 6. $[1].b evaluates to 10. $[2][0] evaluates to 99. As mentioned previously, path components that name keys must be quoted if the unquoted key name is not legal in path expressions. Let $ refer to this value: {\"a fish\": \"shark\", \"a bird\": \"sparrow\"} The keys both contain a space and must be quoted: $.\"a fish\" evaluates to shark. $.\"a bird\" evaluates to sparrow. Paths that use wildcards evaluate to an array that can contain multiple values: mysql > SELECT JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": [3, 4, 5]}' , '$.*' ); + ---------------------------------------------------------+ | JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": [3, 4, 5]}' , '$.*' ) | + ---------------------------------------------------------+ | [ 1 , 2 , [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]] | + ---------------------------------------------------------+ mysql > SELECT JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": [3, 4, 5]}' , '$.c[*]' ); + ------------------------------------------------------------+ | JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": [3, 4, 5]}' , '$.c[*]' ) | + ------------------------------------------------------------+ | [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] | + ------------------------------------------------------------+ In the following example, the path $**.b evaluates to multiple paths ($.a.b and $.c.b) and produces an array of the matching path values: mysql > SELECT JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"a\": {\"b\": 1}, \"c\": {\"b\": 2}}' , '$**.b' ); + ---------------------------------------------------------+ | JSON_EXTRACT ( '{\"a\": {\"b\": 1}, \"c\": {\"b\": 2}}' , '$**.b' ) | + ---------------------------------------------------------+ | [ null , 1 , 2 ] | + ---------------------------------------------------------+ In the following example, showes the querying JSON values from columns: CREATE table t1 ( a json , b int ); INSERT into t1 ( a , b ) values ( '{\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"c\":3}' , 1 ); mysql > SELECT json_extract ( t1 . a , '$.a' ) from t1 where t1 . b = 1 ; + -------------------------+ | json_extract ( t1 . a , $ . a ) | + -------------------------+ | 1 | + -------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) INSERT into t1 ( a , b ) values ( '{\"a\":4,\"b\":5,\"c\":6}' , 2 ); mysql > SELECT json_extract ( t1 . a , '$.b' ) from t1 where t1 . b = 2 ; + -------------------------+ | json_extract ( t1 . a , $ . b ) | + -------------------------+ | 5 | + -------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) mysql > SELECT json_extract ( t1 . a , '$.a' ) from t1 ; + -------------------------+ | json_extract ( t1 . a , $ . a ) | + -------------------------+ | 1 | | 4 | + -------------------------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) INSERT into t1 ( a , b ) values ( '{\"a\":{\"q\":[1,2,3]}}' , 3 ); mysql > SELECT json_extract ( t1 . a , '$.a.q[1]' ) from t1 where t1 . b = 3 ; + ------------------------------+ | json_extract ( t1 . a , $ . a . q [ 1 ]) | + ------------------------------+ | 2 | + ------------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) INSERT into t1 ( a , b ) values ( '[{\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"c\":3},{\"a\":4,\"b\":5,\"c\":6}]' , 4 ); mysql > SELECT json_extract ( t1 . a , '$[1].a' ) from t1 where t1 . b = 4 ; + ----------------------------+ | json_extract ( t1 . a , $ [ 1 ]. a ) | + ----------------------------+ | 4 | + ----------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) JSON_QUOTE() The JSON_QUOTE function converts a string value into a string in JSON format. It wraps the string with double quotes, escapes inner quotes and other characters, quotes the string as a JSON value, and then returns the result as a utf8mb4 string. If the parameter is NULL , it returns NULL . The JSON_QUOTE function is commonly used to generate valid JSON strings to include in JSON documents. The syntax structure is: select JSON_QUOTE(string_value); string_value is the string to be converted to a JSON string. The function returns a string in JSON format, where the original string is surrounded by quotes and properly escaped. Example : mysql > SELECT JSON_QUOTE ( 'null' ), JSON_QUOTE ( '\"null\"' ); + ------------------+--------------------+ | json_quote ( null ) | json_quote ( \"null\" ) | + ------------------+--------------------+ | \"null\" | \"\\\" null \\ \"\" | + ------------------+--------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) mysql > SELECT JSON_QUOTE ( '[1, 2, 3]' ); + -----------------------+ | json_quote ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) | + -----------------------+ | \"[1, 2, 3]\" | + -----------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) mysql > SELECT JSON_QUOTE ( 'hello world' ); + -------------------------+ | json_quote ( hello world ) | + -------------------------+ | \"hello world\" | + -------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) As we can see, the original string is surrounded by quotes, and the double quotes within the string are escaped. This allows it to be used in JSON format, such as as a property value in a JSON object. JSON_UNQUOTE() The JSON_UNQUOTE() function extracts an unquoted JSON value from a JSON string and returns it as a string. Specifically, the JSON_UNQUOTE() function takes a JSON string as input, extracts a JSON value from it, and returns it as a string. If the input JSON string does not contain a valid JSON value or the parameter is NULL , the function returns NULL . An error occurs if the value begins and ends with double quotes but is not a valid JSON string literal. The syntax structure: select JSON_UNQUOTE(string_value); In the string, specific sequences have special meanings and start with a backslash (), known as escape characters, with the following rules. For example, \\b is interpreted as backspace, while \\B is interpreted as B. For all other escape sequences, the backslash is ignored. That is, the escape character is interpreted as unescaped. For example, \\x is just x. These sequences are case-sensitive.

You can use simple wildcards (such as %, _) in LIKE statements, but regular expressions offer more flexibility and matching options. Scenarios Regular expressions can perform complex string matching and manipulation. Here are some common use cases: Data Validation : Regular expressions can validate whether data complies with a specific format, such as checking whether a field contains a valid email address, phone number, or social security number. For example, you can use a regular expression to find all email addresses that do not conform to the standard format: SELECT email FROM users WHERE email NOT REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$' ; Data Filtering : Regular expressions can be used to search for data that contains or does not contain specific patterns. For example, if you want to find all phone numbers that start with a specific prefix, you can use a regular expression to match these numbers: SELECT phone_number FROM users WHERE phone_number REGEXP '^180' ; Data Cleaning : Regular expressions are also instrumental in data cleaning. For example, you may need to clear special characters and spaces or extract numbers from strings; regular expressions can quickly implement these functions: SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE ( name , '[^a-zA-Z]' , '' ) FROM users ; This SQL will return the result of all non-alphabetical characters in the name field being replaced. Text Analysis : If you are conducting text analysis, regular expressions can help you find specific words or phrases in the text and can even be used for certain forms of natural language processing. Special Characters Regular expressions use POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) extended regular expressions. Here are some special characters to note: Character Explanation . Matches any single character (except a newline) * Indicates the preceding element can be repeated any number of times (including zero times) + Indicates the preceding element can be repeated one or more times. ? Indicates the primary element can be repeated zero or once. {n} Indicates the primary element can be repeated n times. {n,} Indicates the primary element can be repeated n times or more. {n,m} Indicates the primary element can be repeated from n to m times. ^ Indicates matching the beginning of the string. $ Indicates matching the end of the string. [abc] Indicates matching a, b, or c. [^abc] Indicates matching any character that is not a, b, or c. (abc|def) Indicates matching abc or def. \\d Indicates matching numbers \\s Indicates matching whitespace characters \\w Indicates matching word characters \\D , \\S and \\W Indicate matching opposite character sets Note In regular expressions, these special characters need to be escaped using \\ ; for example, \\\\. indicates matching an actual . character, not any character. MatrixOne's regular expressions are case-sensitive by default. If you want to perform case-insensitive matching, you can use syntax like REGEXP_LIKE(column, pattern, 'i') . Where i indicates case insensitivity.

Window functions can be used to group, sort, and aggregate the result set and calculate the relevant value of each row of data within each window without changing the number of rows in the result set. That is, the result set can be flexibly analyzed and processed through the window function without introducing additional subqueries or join operations. SQL window functions have a wide range of applications in various business scenarios: Intra-row comparison : Compare a specific value of each row with other rows in the same group, such as calculating the difference between each employee's salary and the department's average salary. At this time, you can use window functions. Data ranking : The window function can quickly generate data ranking information. For example, you can use the RANK() or ROW_NUMBER() function to check the sales ranking. Rolling Calculation : Calculate the moving average. You can define the window range of the window function and then perform rolling calculations. List of window functions Most aggregate functions can also be used as window functions, for example, SUM() , AVG() , and COUNT() . These aggregate functions can be used with window functions to calculate the value of a column within a window Sum, average, or count. For aggregate functions and reference documents supported by MatrixOne that can be used as window functions, see: AVG COUNT MAX SUM MIN See the table below for other window functions: Function name description DENSE_RANK() Used to assign ranks to rows in a dataset, always assigning consecutive ranks to the next value, even if previous values \u200b\u200bhave the same rank.

ROW_NUMBER() Assigns a unique integer value to each row in the query result set, ordered according to the specified collation.

The partition type supported by MatrixOne MatrixOne DDL statements support six partition types, which are the same as the MySQL official website: KEY Partitioning HASH Partitioning Subpartitioning syntax is currently supported, but plan builds are not. 2. About Partition Keys Partition Keys, Primary Keys and Unique Keys The relationship rules of Partition Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys can be summarized as follows: All columns used in a partitioning expression for a partitioned table must be part of every unique key that the table may have. !!! note The Unique KEY includes PrimaryKey and unique key. That is, each unique key on a table must use each column of the table's partitioning expression. A unique key also includes the primary key of a table because, by definition, a table's primary key is also a unique one. Examples For example, because the unique key on the table does not use every column in the table, each statement that creates the table below is invalid: > CREATE TABLE t1 ( col1 INT NOT NULL , col2 DATE NOT NULL , col3 INT NOT NULL , col4 INT NOT NULL , UNIQUE KEY ( col1 , col2 ) ) PARTITION BY HASH ( col3 ) PARTITIONS 4 ; ERROR 1503 ( HY000 ): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table 's partitioning function > CREATE TABLE t2 ( col1 INT NOT NULL, col2 DATE NOT NULL, col3 INT NOT NULL, col4 INT NOT NULL, UNIQUE KEY (col1), UNIQUE KEY (col3) ) PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + col3) PARTITIONS 4; ERROR 1503 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table' s partitioning function About the partition KEY is NULL KEY only accepts lists with Null or more column names. In cases where the table has a primary key, any column used as a partitioning key must contain some or all of the table's primary keys. If no column name is specified as the partitioning key, you can ues the table's primary key. For example, the following CREATE TABLE statement is valid in MySQL. If there is no primary KEY but a UNIQUE KEY, the UNIQUE KEY is used as the partitioning key. For example, in the following table construction sentence, the KEY partition key is NULL, no primary key is defined, but the unique key is used as the partitioning key when the partition expression is constructed: CREATE TABLE t1 ( col1 INT NOT NULL , col2 DATE NOT NULL , col3 INT NOT NULL , col4 INT NOT NULL , UNIQUE KEY ( col1 , col2 ) ) PARTITION BY KEY () PARTITIONS 4 ; Note Other partition rules are the same as MySQL. 3. About MatrixOne Partition Expressions \u200bWhen a DDL statement constructs a partitioned table, a partition expression is generated for each partition definition. The partition expression can calculate the partition to which the data belongs. In the plan build phase, the partition information data structure in the DDL statement is plan.PartitionInfo: type PartitionInfo struct { Type PartitionType Expr * Expr PartitionExpression * Expr Columns [] * Expr PartitionColumns [] string PartitionNum uint64 Partitions [] * PartitionItem Algorithm int64 IsSubPartition bool PartitionMsg string } PartitionExpression is the partition expression. Partition expressions are MatrixOne's way of converting a partition clause into an expression. Each partition expression is constructed as follows: KEY Partitioning KEY partitioning will construct a partition expression based on the partition key and the number of partitions. The result of the partition expression is an integer greater than or equal to 0, representing the partition sequence number, which increases sequentially from zero. SQL example is as below: CREATE TABLE t1 ( col1 INT NOT NULL , col2 DATE NOT NULL , col3 INT NOT NULL , col4 INT NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( col1 , col2 ) ) PARTITION BY KEY ( col1 ) PARTITIONS 4 ; HASH Partitioning HASH partitioning will construct a partition expression based on the partition function and the number of partitions.

GRANT Overview System permissions are those of the initial System account administrator ( The corresponding user is the root ). The System account administrator can create and delete other accounts , and manage accounts . A System account administrator cannot manage other resources of other accounts . To use GRANT to GRANT permissions to other users or roles, you must first have the WITH GRANT OPTION permissions and the permissions you are granting. Use the' SHOW GRANTS' statement to find out the grant status of your current or another role. For more information, see SHOW GRANTS . The REVOKE statement is related to GRANT and enables administrators to remove account privileges. For more information on REVOKE , see REVOKE . Normally, a cluster has one root by default, the root first uses CREATE ACCOUNT to create a new account and define its nonprivilege characteristics such as its password, then account uses CREATE USER to create an user and uses GRANT to define its privileges. ALTER ACCOUNT may be used to change the nonprivilege characteristics of existing accounts. ALTER USER is used to change the privilege characteristics of existing users. For more information on privileges supported by MatrixOne, see Privilege Control Types . GRANT responds with Query OK, 0 rows affected when executed successfully.

[WITH ADMIN OPTION] object_type: { TABLE | FUNCTION | PROCEDURE } priv_level: { * | *.* | db_name.* | db_name.tbl_name | tbl_name | db_name.routine_name } Explanations The GRANT statement enables account to grant privileges and roles, which can be granted to users and roles. These syntax restrictions apply: GRANT cannot mix granting both privileges and roles in the same statement. A given GRANT statement must grant either privileges or roles. The ON clause distinguishes whether the statement grants privileges or roles: With ON , the statement grants privileges. Without ON , the statement grants roles. It is permitted to assign both privileges and roles to an account, but you must use separate GRANT statements, each with syntax appropriate to what is to be granted. To grant a privilege with GRANT , you must have the GRANT OPTION privilege, and you must have the privileges that you are granting. Database Privileges Database privileges apply to all objects in a given database. To assign database-level privileges, use ON db_name * syntax: grant all on database * to role1; Table Privileges Table privileges apply to all columns in a given table. To assign table-level privileges, use ON db_name.tbl_name syntax: grant all on table *.* to role1; Granting Roles GRANT syntax without an ON clause grants roles rather than individual privileges. A role is a named collection of privileges. For example: grant role3 to role_user; Each role to be granted must exist, as well as each user account or role to which it is to be granted. These privileges are required to grant roles: You have the privilege to grant or revoke any role to users or roles.

A sequence is a unique database object that can automatically generate a unique sequence of numbers. Typically, sequences are used to automatically generate unique values for a table's primary key fields. CREATE SEQUENCE is a command that creates an auto-increment number sequence to generate unique, continuous numeric values, usually used to create values for primary key columns or other columns requiring auto-increment numbers. Syntax > CREATE SEQUENCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] SEQUENCE_NAME [ AS data_type ] [ INCREMENT [ BY ] increment ] [ MINVALUE minvalue] [ MAXVALUE maxvalue] [ START [ WITH ] start ] [ [ NO ] CYCLE ] Explanations data_type The optional clause AS data_type specifies the data type of the sequence. Supported data types include smallint [unsigned] , integer [unsigned] , and bigint [unsigned] , with bigint being the default. The data type determines the default minimum and maximum values for the sequence. INCREMENT The optional clause INCREMENT [BY] increment specifies the value to add to the current sequence value to create a new value. Positive values generate ascending sequences, and negative values generate descending sequences; the default value is 1. MINVALUE The optional clause MINVALUE minvalue determines the minimum value that the sequence can generate. If this clause is not provided or MINVALUE is not specified, a default value will be used. The default value for an ascending sequence is 1 , and for a descending sequence it is the minimum value for the data type. MAXVALUE The optional clause MAXVALUE maxvalue determines the maximum value for the sequence. If this clause is not provided or MAXVALUE is not specified, a default value will be used. The default value for an ascending sequence is the maximum value for the data type, and for a descending sequence it is -1 . START The optional clause START [WITH] start allows the sequence to start from any point. The default starting value is the minimum value for an ascending sequence and the maximum value for a descending sequence. CYCLE The CYCLE option allows the sequence to wrap around when it reaches the maximum or minimum value for an ascending or descending sequence, respectively. If the limit is reached, the next generated number will be the minimum or maximum value, respectively. Operations The following functions are used to manipulate sequence values: NEXTVAL(sequence_name) Sets the current value to the next value in the sequence and returns it. CURRVAL(sequence_name) Returns the current value in the sequence. SETVAL(sequence_name, n [,b]) Sets the current value in the sequence to n. If b is set to true, the next call to NEXTVAL will return n . If b is set to false, the next call to NEXTVAL will return n+increment . LASTVAL() Return the value of any sequence obtained by NEXTVAL in the current session; if the current value is set by SETVAL first, and then use LASTVAL to operate on the sequence, return SETVAL The current value of the setting. Since 'LASTVAL()' returns a 'NEXTVAL' value, 'LASTVAL()' can only be initialized by 'NEXTVAL'. LASTVAL() is affected by SETVAL(sequence_name, n [,true]) to change the current value, as shown in the following example: Suppose a sequence named seq_id was created with a starting value of 1, an increment of 1, and a maximum value of 1000: CREATE SEQUENCE seq_id INCREMENT BY 1 MAXVALUE 1000 START with 1 ; Then, the NEXTVAL() function can be used to get the next sequence value and automatically increment the sequence counter: SELECT NEXTVAL ( 'seq_id' ); Next, the LASTVAL() function can be used to return the current value of the sequence: SELECT LASTVAL (); Alternatively, the SETVAL() function can be used to set the current value to 30, with the optional [,b] parameter set to true: SELECT SETVAL ( 'seq_id' , 30 ); Afterward, the NEXTVAL() function can be used again to get the next sequence value: SELECT NEXTVAL ( 'seq_id' ); This will return 31 because the current value has been set to 30, and the NEXTVAL() function will return the next sequence value 31. SELECT LASTVAL (); Using LASTVAL() will return the value of the sequence that was retrieved with NEXTVAL() in the current session, which is 31 in this case. The above example shows that if the current value is set using SETVAL(sequence_name, n [,true]) and then the next sequence value is retrieved using NEXTVAL , calling LASTVAL() again will return the value of the sequence retrieved with NEXTVAL() . Using SEQUENCE in a table To use a sequence in a table, the following steps need to be completed: Create a sequence object: A sequence named \"my_sequence\" can be created using the following SQL command: CREATE SEQUENCE my_sequence ; This will create a simple sequence object that will start at 1 and increment by 1. Apply a sequence to a field in a table: To apply a sequence to a field in a table, you need to specify a default value for the next value in the sequence in the table definition, as follows: CREATE TABLE my_table ( id INTEGER DEFAULT nextval ( 'my_sequence' ), name VARCHAR ( 50 )); In the example above, the \"id\" field will automatically get the following unique value from the sequence as its default value. Insert data: After the table and sequence have been defined, you can use the INSERT statement to insert data into the table. When inserting a row of data, if no value is specified for the \"id\" field, MatrixOne will automatically get the following unique value from the sequence as its default value. For example, the following statement will insert a row into the \"my_table\" table and automatically assign a unique value to the \"id\" field: INSERT INTO my_table ( name ) VALUES ( 'John' ); INSERT INTO my_table ( name ) VALUES ( 'Tom' ); Using sequences makes it easy to automatically assign unique identifiers in the form, thus avoiding the possible errors of manually assigning identifiers. Use the following statement for query verification: mysql > select * from my_table ; + ------+------+ | id | name | + ------+------+ | 1 | John | | 2 | Tom | + ------+------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) Note When using SEQUENCE in a table, the auto_increment and sequence cannot be used together; otherwise, an error will be reported. Examples -- Create a sequence named \"seq_id\" that starts from 1, increments by 1, and has a maximum value of 1000: CREATE SEQUENCE seq_id INCREMENT BY 1 MAXVALUE 1000 START with 1 ; -- After creating the sequence, the NEXTVAL function can be used to retrieve the next sequence value as shown below: mysql > SELECT NEXTVAL ( 'seq_id' ); + -----------------+ | nextval ( seq_id ) | + -----------------+ | 1 | + -----------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 02 sec ) -- This command will return the next value in the sequence (e.g., 1) and automatically increment the counter of the sequence. -- The CURRVAL function returns the current value. mysql > SELECT CURRVAL ( 'seq_id' ); + -----------------+ | currval ( seq_id ) | + -----------------+ | 1 | + -----------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) -- Returns the most recent value retrieved by NEXTVAL in the current session for any sequence. mysql > SELECT LASTVAL (); + -----------+ | lastval () | + -----------+ | 1 | + -----------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) -- Set the current value to 30. mysql > SELECT SETVAL ( 'seq_id' , 30 ); + --------------------+ | setval ( seq_id , 30 ) | + --------------------+ | 30 | + --------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 02 sec ) -- The NEXTVAL function retrieves the next sequence value. mysql > SELECT NEXTVAL ( 'seq_id' ); + -----------------+ | nextval ( seq_id ) | + -----------------+ | 31 | + -----------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec )","title":"CREATE SEQUENCE"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/create-sequence/#create-sequence","text":"","title":"CREATE SEQUENCE"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/create-sequence/#description","text":"The CREATE SEQUENCE user creates a sequence object.

Syntax > CREATE [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]table_name [comment = \"comment of table\"]; ( name1 type1 [comment 'comment of column'] [AUTO_INCREMENT] [[PRIMARY] KEY] [[FOREIGN] KEY], name2 type2 [comment 'comment of column'], ... ) [cluster by (column_name1, column_name2, ...);] [partition_options] Explanations Temporary Tables You can use the TEMPORARY keyword when creating a table. A TEMPORARY table is visible only within the current session, and is dropped automatically when the session is closed. This means that two different sessions can use the same temporary table name without conflicting with each other or with an existing non-TEMPORARY table of the same name. (The existing table is hidden until the temporary table is dropped.) Dropping a database does automatically drop any TEMPORARY tables created within that database. The creating session can perform any operation on the table, such as DROP TABLE , INSERT , UPDATE , or SELECT . COMMENT A comment for a column or a table can be specified with the COMMENT option. Up to 1024 characters long. The comment is displayed by the SHOW CREATE TABLE and SHOW FULL COLUMNS statements. It is also shown in the COLUMN_COMMENT column of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS table. AUTO_INCREMENT The initial AUTO_INCREMENT value for the table. An integer column can have the additional attribute AUTO_INCREMENT . When you insert a value of NULL (recommended) or 0 into an indexed AUTO_INCREMENT column, the column is set to the next sequence value. Typically this is value+1, where value is the largest value for the column currently in the table. AUTO_INCREMENT sequences begin with 1. There can be only one AUTO_INCREMENT column per table, it must be indexed, and it cannot have a DEFAULT value. An AUTO_INCREMENT column works properly only if it contains only positive values. Inserting a negative number is regarded as inserting a very large positive number. This is done to avoid precision problems when numbers \"wrap\" over from positive to negative and also to ensure that you do not accidentally get an AUTO_INCREMENT column that contains 0. PRIMARY KEY The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single column (field). SQL PRIMARY KEY on CREATE TABLE The following SQL creates a PRIMARY KEY on the \"ID\" column when the \"Persons\" table is created: > CREATE TABLE Persons ( ID int NOT NULL, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Age int, PRIMARY KEY (ID) ); FOREIGN KEY The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables. A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table. The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table. When defining FOREIGN KEY, the following rules need to be followed: The parent table must already exist in the database or be a table currently being created. In the latter case, the parent table and the slave table are the same table, such a table is called a self-referential table, and this structure is called self-referential integrity. A primary key must be defined for the parent table. Specify the column name or combination of column names after the table name of the parent table. This column or combination of columns must be the primary or candidate key of the primary table. The number of columns in the foreign key must be the same as the number of columns in the primary key of the parent table. The data type of the column in the foreign key must be the same as the data type of the corresponding column in the primary key of the parent table. The following is an example to illustrate the association of parent and child tables through FOREIGN KEY and PRIMARY KEY: First, create a parent table with field a as the primary key: create table t1 ( a int primary key , b varchar ( 5 )); insert into t1 values ( 101 , 'abc' ),( 102 , 'def' ); mysql > select * from t1 ; + ------+------+ | a | b | + ------+------+ | 101 | abc | | 102 | def | + ------+------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) Then create a child table with field c as the foreign key, associated with parent table field a: create table t2 ( a int , b varchar ( 5 ), c int , foreign key ( c ) references t1 ( a )); insert into t2 values ( 1 , 'zs1' , 101 ),( 2 , 'zs2' , 102 ); insert into t2 values ( 3 , 'xyz' , null ); mysql > select * from t2 ; + ------+------+------+ | a | b | c | + ------+------+------+ | 1 | zs1 | 101 | | 2 | zs2 | 102 | | 3 | xyz | NULL | + ------+------+------+ 3 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) For more information on data integrity constraints, see Data Integrity Constraints Overview . Cluster by Cluster by is a command used to optimize the physical arrangement of a table. When creating a table, the Cluster by command can physically sort the table based on a specified column for tables without a primary key. It will rearrange the data rows to match the order of values in that column. Using Cluster by improves query performance. The syntax for a single column is: create table() cluster by col; The syntax for multiple columns is: create table() cluster by (col1, col2); Note: Cluster by cannot coexist with a primary key, or a syntax error will occur. Cluster by can only be specified when creating a table and does not support dynamic creation. For more information on using Cluster by for performing tuning, see Using Cluster by for performance tuning . Table PARTITION and PARTITIONS partition_options: PARTITION BY { [LINEAR] HASH(expr) | [LINEAR] KEY [ALGORITHM={1 | 2}] (column_list) [PARTITIONS num] [(partition_definition [, partition_definition] ...)] partition_definition: PARTITION partition_name [VALUES {LESS THAN {(expr | value_list) | MAXVALUE} | IN (value_list)}] [COMMENT [=] 'string' ] Partitions can be modified, merged, added to tables, and dropped from tables. PARTITION BY If used, a partition_options clause begins with PARTITION BY. This clause contains the function that is used to determine the partition; the function returns an integer value ranging from 1 to num, where num is the number of partitions. HASH(expr) Hashes one or more columns to create a key for placing and locating rows. expr is an expression using one or more table columns. For example, these are both valid CREATE TABLE statements using PARTITION BY HASH: CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5)) PARTITION BY HASH(col1); CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATETIME) PARTITION BY HASH ( YEAR(col3) ); KEY(column_list) This is similar to HASH . The column_list argument is simply a list of 1 or more table columns (maximum: 16). This example shows a simple table partitioned by key, with 4 partitions: CREATE TABLE tk (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATE) PARTITION BY KEY(col3) PARTITIONS 4; For tables that are partitioned by key, you can employ linear partitioning by using the LINEAR keyword. This has the same effect as with tables that are partitioned by HASH . This example uses linear partitioning by key to distribute data between 5 partitions: CREATE TABLE tk (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATE) PARTITION BY LINEAR KEY(col3) PARTITIONS 5; RANGE(expr) In this case, expr shows a range of values using a set of VALUES LESS THAN operators. When using range partitioning, you must define at least one partition using VALUES LESS THAN . You cannot use VALUES IN with range partitioning. PARTITION ... VALUES LESS THAN ... statements work in a consecutive fashion. VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE works to specify \"leftover\" values that are greater than the maximum value otherwise specified. The clauses must be arranged in such a way that the upper limit specified in each successive VALUES LESS THAN is greater than that of the previous one, with the one referencing MAXVALUE coming last of all in the list. PARTITIONS num The number of partitions may optionally be specified with a PARTITIONS num clause, where num is the number of partitions. If both this clause and any PARTITION clauses are used, num must be equal to the total number of any partitions that are declared using PARTITION clauses.

PARTITION BY If used, a partition_options clause begins with PARTITION BY. This clause contains the function that is used to determine the partition; the function returns an integer value ranging from 1 to num, where num is the number of partitions. HASH(expr) Hashes one or more columns to create a key for placing and locating rows. expr is an expression using one or more table columns. For example, these are both valid CREATE TABLE statements using PARTITION BY HASH: CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5)) PARTITION BY HASH(col1); CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATETIME) PARTITION BY HASH ( YEAR(col3) ); KEY(column_list) This is similar to HASH . The column_list argument is simply a list of 1 or more table columns (maximum: 16). This example shows a simple table partitioned by key, with 4 partitions: CREATE TABLE tk (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATE) PARTITION BY KEY(col3) PARTITIONS 4; For tables that are partitioned by key, you can employ linear partitioning by using the LINEAR keyword. This has the same effect as with tables that are partitioned by HASH . This example uses linear partitioning by key to distribute data between 5 partitions: CREATE TABLE tk (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATE) PARTITION BY LINEAR KEY(col3) PARTITIONS 5; RANGE(expr) In this case, expr shows a range of values using a set of VALUES LESS THAN operators. When using range partitioning, you must define at least one partition using VALUES LESS THAN . You cannot use VALUES IN with range partitioning. PARTITION ... VALUES LESS THAN ... statements work in a consecutive fashion. VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE works to specify \"leftover\" values that are greater than the maximum value otherwise specified. The clauses must be arranged in such a way that the upper limit specified in each successive VALUES LESS THAN is greater than that of the previous one, with the one referencing MAXVALUE coming last of all in the list. PARTITIONS num The number of partitions may optionally be specified with a PARTITIONS num clause, where num is the number of partitions. If both this clause and any PARTITION clauses are used, num must be equal to the total number of any partitions that are declared using PARTITION clauses.","title":"Table PARTITION and PARTITIONS"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/create-table/#examples","text":"Example 1: Create a common table CREATE TABLE test ( a int , b varchar ( 10 ));

Syntax Syntax 1 CASE case_value WHEN when_value THEN statement_list [WHEN when_value THEN statement_list] ... [ELSE statement_list] END CASE For the first syntax, case_value is an expression. This value is compared to the when_value expression in each WHEN clause until one of them is equal. When an equal when_value is found, the corresponding THEN clause statement_list executes. If no when_value is equal, the ELSE clause statement_list executes, if there is one. This syntax cannot be used to test for equality with NULL because NULL = NULL is false. Syntax 2 CASE WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list [WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list] ... [ELSE statement_list] END CASE For the second syntax, each WHEN clause search_condition expression is evaluated until one is true, at which point its corresponding THEN clause statement_list executes. If no search_condition is equal, the ELSE clause statement_list executes, if there is one.

The file can be read from the server host or a S3 compatible object storage . LOAD DATA is the complement of SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE . To write data from a table to a file, use SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE . To read the file back into a table, use LOAD DATA. The syntax of the FIELDS and LINES clauses is the same for both statements. Syntax > LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INFILE 'file_name' INTO TABLE tbl_name [{FIELDS | COLUMNS} [TERMINATED BY 'string'] [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char'] ] [LINES [STARTING BY 'string'] [TERMINATED BY 'string'] ] [IGNORE number {LINES | ROWS}] [SET column_name_1=nullif(column_name_1, expr1), column_name_2=nullif(column_name_2, expr2)...] [PARALLEL {'TRUE' | 'FALSE'}] Input File Location LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' : Indicates that the data file to be loaded is on the same machine as the MatrixOne host server. file_name can be the relative path name of the storage location of the file, or it can be the absolute path name. LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'file_name' : indicates that the data file to be loaded is not on the same machine as the MatrixOne host server; that is, the data file is on the client server. file_name can be the relative path name of the storage location of the file, or it can be the absolute path name. IGNORE LINES The IGNORE number LINES clause can be used to ignore lines at the start of the file. For example, you can use IGNORE 1 LINES to skip an initial header line containing column names: LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE table1 IGNORE 1 LINES; Field and Line Handling For both the LOAD DATA and SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statements, the syntax of the FIELDS and LINES clauses is the same. Both clauses are optional, but FIELDS must precede LINES if both are specified. If you specify a FIELDS clause, each of its subclauses ( TERMINATED BY , [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY ) is also optional, except that you must specify at least one of them. Arguments to these clauses are permitted to contain only ASCII characters. If you specify no FIELDS or LINES clause, the defaults are the same as if you had written this: FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n' FIELDS TERMINATED BY FIELDS TERMINATED BY specifies the delimiter for a field. The FIELDS TERMINATED BY values can be more than one character. For example, to read the comma-delimited file, the correct statement is: LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','; If instead you tried to read the file with the statement shown following, it would not work because it instructs LOAD DATA to look for tabs between fields: LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\\t'; The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as a single field. You may encounter an error of \"ERROR 20101 (HY000): internal error: the table column is larger than input data column\" . FIELDS ENCLOSED BY FIELDS TERMINATED BY option specifies the character enclose the input values. ENCLOSED BY value must be a single character. If the input values are not necessarily enclosed within quotation marks, use OPTIONALLY before the ENCLOSED BY option. For example, if some input values are enclosed within quotation marks, some are not: LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '\"'; LINES TERMINATED BY LINES TERMINATED BY specifies the delimiter for the a line. The LINES TERMINATED BY values can be more than one character. For example, if the lines in a csv file are terminated by carriage return/newline pairs, you can load it with LINES TERMINATED BY '\\r\\n' : LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\r\\n'; LINE STARTING BY If all the input lines have a common prefix that you want to ignore, you can use LINES STARTING BY 'prefix_string' to skip the prefix and anything before it. If a line does not include the prefix, the entire line is skipped. Suppose that you issue the following statement: LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES STARTING BY 'xxx'; If the data file looks like this: xxx\"abc\",1 something xxx\"def\",2 \"ghi\",3 The resulting rows are (\"abc\",1) and (\"def\",2). The third row in the file is skipped because it does not contain the prefix. SET MatrixOne only supports SET column_name=nullif(column_name,expr) . That is, when column_name = expr , it returns NULL ; otherwise, it returns the original value of column_name . For example, SET a=nullif(a,1) , if a=1, returns NULL ; otherwise, it returns the original value of column a. By setting the parameter, you can use SET column_name=nullif(column_name,\"null\") to return the NULL value in the column when loading the file. Example The details of the local file test.txt are as follows: id,user_name,sex 1,\"weder\",\"man\" 2,\"tom\",\"man\" null,wederTom,\"man\" Create a table named user in MatrixOne: create database aaa ; use aaa ; CREATE TABLE ` user ` ( ` id ` int ( 11 ) , ` user_name ` varchar ( 255 ) , ` sex ` varchar ( 255 )); Load test.txt into the table user : LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE user SET id = nullif ( id , \"null\" ); The result of the talbe is as below: select * from user ; + ------+-----------+------+ | id | user_name | sex | + ------+-----------+------+ | 1 | weder | man | | 2 | tom | man | | null | wederTom | man | + ------+-----------+------+ PARALLEL For a sizeable well-formed file, such as a JSOLLines file or a CSV file with no line breaks in a line of data, you can use PARALLEL to load the file in parallel to speed up the loading. For example, for a large file of 2 G, use two threads to load; the second thread first splits and locates the 1G position, then reads and loads backward. In this way, two threads can read large files at the same time, and each thread can read 1G of data. Enable/Disable Parallel Loading Command Line Example : -- Enable Parallel Loading load data infile 'file_name' into table tbl_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ENCLOSED BY '\\\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n' IGNORE 1 LINES PARALLEL 'TRUE' ; -- Disable Parallel Loading load data infile 'file_name' into table tbl_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ENCLOSED BY '\\\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n' IGNORE 1 LINES PARALLEL 'FALSE' ; -- Parallel loading is disabled by default load data infile 'file_name' into table tbl_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ENCLOSED BY '\\\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n' IGNORE 1 LINES ; Note [PARALLEL {'TRUE' | 'FALSE'}] currently only support TRUE or FALSE and are not case-sensitive. Note: If the PARALLEL field is not added in the LOAD statement, for CSV files, parallel loading is disabled by default; for JSOLLines files, parallel loading is enabled by default. If there is a line terminator in the CSV file, such as '\\n', otherwise it may cause data errors when the file is loaded. If the file is too large, manually splitting the file from the '\\n' as the starting and ending point is recommended, then enabling parallel loading. Supported file formats In MatrixOne's current release, LOAD DATA supports CSV(comma-separated values) format and JSONLines format file. See full tutorials for loading csv and jsonline . CSV format standard description The CSV format loaded by MatrixOne conforms to the RFC4180 standard, and the CSV format is specified as follows: Each record is on a separate line, separated by a newline character (CRLF): aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF Imported into the table as follows: +---------+---------+---------+ | col1 | col2 | col3 | +---------+---------+---------+ | aaa | b bb | ccc | | zzz | yyy | xxx | +---------+---------+---------+ The last record in the file can have a terminating newline or no terminating newline (CRLF): aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF zzz,yyy,xxx Imported into the table as follows: +---------+---------+---------+ | col1 | col2 | col3 | +---------+---------+---------+ | aaa | b bb | ccc | | zzz | yyy | xxx | +---------+---------+---------+ An optional header line appears as the first line of the file and has the same format as a standard record line. For example: field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF Imported into the table as follows: +------------+------------+------------+ | field_name | field_name | field_name | +------------+------------+------------+ | aaa | bbb | ccc | | zzz | yyy | xxx | +------------+------------+------------+ In the header and each record, there may be one or more fields separated by commas. Whitespace within a field is part of the field and should not be ignored. A comma cannot follow the last field in each record. For example: aaa,bbb,ccc Or: a aa, bbb,cc c Both examples are correct. Imported into the table as follows: +---------+---------+---------+ | col1 | col2 | col3 | +---------+---------+---------+ | aaa | bbb | ccc | +---------+---------+---------+ Or: +---------+---------+---------+ | col1 | col2 | col3 | +---------+---------+---------+ | a aa | bbb | cc c | +---------+---------+---------+ Each field can be enclosed in double quotes or not. Double quotes cannot appear inside a field if the field is not enclosed in double-quotes. For example: \"aaa\",\"bbb\",\"ccc\" CRLF zzz,yyy,xxx Or: \"aaa\",\"bbb\",ccc CRLF zzz,yyy,xxx Both examples are correct. Imported into the table as follows: +---------+---------+---------+ | col1 | col2 | col3 | +---------+---------+---------+ | aaa | bbb | ccc | | zzz | yyy | xxx | +---------+---------+---------+ Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas should be enclosed in double-quotes. For example: \"aaa\",\"b CRLF bb\",\"ccc\" CRLF zzz,yyy,xxx Imported into the table as follows: +---------+---------+---------+ | col1 | col2 | col3 | +---------+---------+---------+ | aaa | b bb | ccc | | zzz | yyy | xxx | +---------+---------+---------+ If double quotation marks are used to enclose the field, then multiple double quotation marks appearing in the field must also be enclosed in double quotation marks; otherwise, the first quotation mark of two double quotation marks in the field will be parsed as an escape character, thus keep a single, double quote. For example: \"aaa\",\"b\",\"bb\",\"ccc\" The above CSV will parse \"b\"\"bb\" into b\"bb ; if the correct field is b\"\"bb , then it should be written as: \"aaa\",\"b\"\"\"\"bb\",\"ccc\" Or: \"aaa\",b\"\"bb,\"ccc\" Imported into the table as follows: +---------+---------+---------+ | col1 | col2 | col3 | +---------+---------+---------+ | aaa | b\"\"bb | ccc | +---------+---------+---------+ Examples The SSB Test is an example of LOAD DATA syntax.

For more information on loding JSONLines , see Import the JSONLines data . Constraints The REPLACE and IGNORE modifiers control handling of new (input) rows that duplicate existing table rows on unique key values ( PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index values) are not supported in MatrixOne yet. Input pre-pressing with SET is supported very limitedly. Only SET columns_name=nullif(expr1,expr2) is supported. When enabling the parallel loading, it must be ensured that each row of data in the file does not contain the specified line terminator, such as '\\n'; otherwise, it will cause data errors during file loading. The parallel loading of files requires that the files be in uncompressed format, and parallel loading of files in compressed form is not currently supported. When you use load data local , you need to use the command line to connect to the MatrixOne service host: mysql -h <mo-host -ip> -P 6001 -udump -p111 --local-infile . MatrixOne does not support ESCAPED BY currently. Writing or reading special characters differs from MySQL to some extent.","title":"LOAD DATA"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Manipulation-Language/load-data/#load-data","text":"","title":"LOAD DATA"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Manipulation-Language/load-data/#description","text":"The LOAD DATA statement reads rows from a text file into a table at a very high speed.

INTO OUTFILE statements, the syntax of the FIELDS and LINES clauses is the same. Both clauses are optional, but FIELDS must precede LINES if both are specified. If you specify a FIELDS clause, each of its subclauses ( TERMINATED BY , [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY ) is also optional, except that you must specify at least one of them. Arguments to these clauses are permitted to contain only ASCII characters. If you specify no FIELDS or LINES clause, the defaults are the same as if you had written this: FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n' FIELDS TERMINATED BY FIELDS TERMINATED BY specifies the delimiter for a field. The FIELDS TERMINATED BY values can be more than one character. For example, to read the comma-delimited file, the correct statement is: LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','; If instead you tried to read the file with the statement shown following, it would not work because it instructs LOAD DATA to look for tabs between fields: LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\\t'; The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as a single field. You may encounter an error of \"ERROR 20101 (HY000): internal error: the table column is larger than input data column\" . FIELDS ENCLOSED BY FIELDS TERMINATED BY option specifies the character enclose the input values. ENCLOSED BY value must be a single character. If the input values are not necessarily enclosed within quotation marks, use OPTIONALLY before the ENCLOSED BY option. For example, if some input values are enclosed within quotation marks, some are not: LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '\"'; LINES TERMINATED BY LINES TERMINATED BY specifies the delimiter for the a line. The LINES TERMINATED BY values can be more than one character. For example, if the lines in a csv file are terminated by carriage return/newline pairs, you can load it with LINES TERMINATED BY '\\r\\n' : LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\r\\n'; LINE STARTING BY If all the input lines have a common prefix that you want to ignore, you can use LINES STARTING BY 'prefix_string' to skip the prefix and anything before it. If a line does not include the prefix, the entire line is skipped. Suppose that you issue the following statement: LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES STARTING BY 'xxx'; If the data file looks like this: xxx\"abc\",1 something xxx\"def\",2 \"ghi\",3 The resulting rows are (\"abc\",1) and (\"def\",2).

For example, for a large file of 2 G, use two threads to load; the second thread first splits and locates the 1G position, then reads and loads backward. In this way, two threads can read large files at the same time, and each thread can read 1G of data.

There must be at least one select_expr . The list of select_expr terms comprises the select list that indicates which columns to retrieve. Terms specify a column or expression or can use *-shorthand: A select list consisting only of a single unqualified * can be used as shorthand to select all columns from all tables: SELECT * FROM t1 tbl_name.* can be used as a qualified shorthand to select all columns from the named table: SELECT t1.*, t2.* FROM t1 A select_expr can be given an alias using AS alias_name. table_references The FROM table_references clause indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve rows. You can refer to a table within the default database as tbl_name , or as db_name.tbl_name to specify a database explicitly. You can refer to a column as col_name , tbl_name.col_name , or db_name.tbl_name.col_name . You need not specify a tbl_name or db_name.tbl_name prefix for a column reference unless the reference would be ambiguous. A table reference can be aliased using tbl_name AS alias_name or tbl_name alias_name . WHERE The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause. GROUP BY Columns selected for output can be referred to in ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses using column names, column aliases, or column positions. HAVING The HAVING clause, like the WHERE clause, specifies selection conditions. ORDER BY To sort in reverse order, add the DESC (descending) keyword to the name of the column in the ORDER BY clause that you are sorting by. The default is ascending order; this can be specified explicitly using the ASC keyword. LIMIT The LIMIT clause can be used to constrain the number of rows returned by the SELECT statement. FOR UPDATE SELECT...FOR UPDATE is mainly used to lock a set of data rows in transaction processing to prevent them from being modified by other concurrent transactions. This statement is most commonly used in \"read-modify-write\" scenarios. That is, when you need to read a data set, make changes to it, and then write the results back to the database, you don't want other transactions to modify this data set. Using SELECT FOR UPDATE in a transaction can lock the selected rows until the transaction ends (either by commit or rollback) and the locks are released. This way, other transactions attempting to modify these rows are blocked until the first transaction is complete. See the example below: START TRANSACTION ; SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = 1 FOR UPDATE ; In the above transaction, the SELECT FOR UPDATE statement selects and locks the row with OrderID 1 in the Orders table. Other transactions cannot modify this row before the transaction ends. After you have finished modifying this row, you can commit the transaction to release the lock: UPDATE Orders SET Quantity = Quantity - 1 WHERE OrderID = 1 ; COMMIT ; The above UPDATE statement modifies the Quantity value of the selected row, and then the COMMIT statement commits the transaction and releases the lock. At this point, other blocked transactions can continue. If you decide not to make any changes, you can use the ROLLBACK statement to end the transaction and release the lock.

Syntax SELECT ... UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] SELECT ... [UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] SELECT ...] Arguments UNION [DISTINCT] and UNION ALL By default, duplicate rows are removed from the UNION results. UNION is used as the same as UNION [DISTINCT] . Combining the result sets of two or more queries using the UNION operator requires the following conditions: All SELECT statements must have the same number and order of columns. Data types must be same or convertible. With UNION ALL , repeated lines (if available) are retained in the result. ORDER BY and LIMIT In UNION To apply an ORDER BY or LIMIT clause to an individual SELECT , parenthesize the SELECT and place the clause inside the parentheses: Use of ORDER BY for individual SELECT statements implies nothing about the order in which the rows appear in the final result because UNION by default produces an unordered set of rows. Therefore, ORDER BY in this context typically is used in conjunction with LIMIT, to determine the subset of the selected rows to retrieve for the SELECT , even though it does not necessarily affect the order of those rows in the final UNION result. For example: (SELECT a FROM t1 WHERE a=10 AND B=1 ORDER BY a LIMIT 10) UNION (SELECT a FROM t2 WHERE a=11 AND B=2 ORDER BY a LIMIT 10); Or: (SELECT a FROM t1 WHERE a=10 AND B=1) UNION (SELECT a FROM t2 WHERE a=11 AND B=2) ORDER BY a LIMIT 10; Examples CREATE TABLE t1 ( id INT PRIMARY KEY ); CREATE TABLE t2 ( id INT PRIMARY KEY ); INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ( 1 ),( 2 ),( 3 ); INSERT INTO t2 VALUES ( 2 ),( 3 ),( 4 ); mysql > SELECT id FROM t1 UNION SELECT id FROM t2 ; + ------+ | id | + ------+ | 4 | | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | + ------+ mysql > SELECT id FROM t1 UNION ALL SELECT id FROM t2 ; + ------+ | id | + ------+ | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | | 2 | | 3 | | 4 | + ------+ drop table t1 ; CREATE TABLE t1 ( a INT , b INT ); INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ROW ( 4 , - 2 ), ROW ( 5 , 9 ), ROW ( 10 , 1 ), ROW ( 11 , 2 ), ROW ( 13 , 5 ); drop table t2 ; CREATE TABLE t2 ( a INT , b INT ); INSERT INTO t2 VALUES ROW ( 1 , 2 ), ROW ( 3 , 4 ), ROW ( 11 , 2 ), ROW ( 10 , 3 ), ROW ( 15 , 8 ); mysql > ( SELECT a FROM t1 WHERE a = 10 AND B = 1 ORDER BY a LIMIT 10 ) UNION ( SELECT a FROM t2 WHERE a = 11 AND B = 2 ORDER BY a LIMIT 10 ); + ------+ | a | + ------+ | 10 | | 11 | + ------+","title":"UNION"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Query-Language/union/#union","text":"","title":"UNION"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Query-Language/union/#description","text":"UNION combines the result from multiple SELECT statements into a single result set.","title":"Description"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Query-Language/union/#syntax","text":"SELECT ...

When execution finishes, EXPLAIN ANALYZE will print the plan and the measurements instead of the query result. EXPLAIN ANALYZE , which runs a statement and produces EXPLAIN output along with timing and additional, iterator-based, information about how the optimizer's expectations matched the actual execution. For each iterator, the following information is provided: Estimated execution cost Some iterators are not accounted for by the cost model, and so are not included in the estimate. Estimated number of returned rows Time to return first row Time spent executing this iterator (including child iterators, but not parent iterators), in milliseconds. Number of rows returned by the iterator Number of loops The query execution information is displayed using the TREE output format, in which nodes represent iterators. EXPLAIN ANALYZE always uses the TREE output format, also can optionally be specified explicitly using FORMAT=TREE; formats other than TREE remain unsupported.

Syntax EXPLAIN [ ( option [, ...] ) ] statement where option can be one of: ANALYZE [ boolean ] VERBOSE [ boolean ] FORMAT { TEXT | JSON } Description This command displays the execution plan that the MatrixOne planner generates for the supplied statement. The execution plan shows how the table(s) referenced by the statement will be scanned \u2014 by plain sequential scan, index scan, and so on. \u2014 and if multiple tables are referenced, what join algorithms will be used to bring together the required rows from each input table. The most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in cost units that are arbitrary, but conventionally mean disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up cost before the first row can be returned, and the total cost to return all the rows. For most queries the total cost is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery in EXISTS , the planner will choose the smallest start-up cost instead of the smallest total cost (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with a LIMIT clause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest. The ANALYZE option causes the statement to be actually executed, not only planned. Then actual run time statistics are added to the display, including the total elapsed time expended within each plan node (in milliseconds) and the total number of rows it actually returned. This is useful for seeing whether the planner's estimates are close to reality. Parameters ANALYZE: Carry out the command and show actual run times and other statistics. This parameter defaults to FALSE . VERBOSE: Display additional information regarding the plan. Specifically, include the output column list for each node in the plan tree, schema-qualify table and function names, always label variables in expressions with their range table alias, and always print the name of each trigger for which statistics are displayed. This parameter is FALSE by default. FORMAT: Specify the output format, which can be TEXT, JSON. Non-text output contains the same information as the text output format, but is easier for programs to parse. This parameter is TEXT by dafault. BOOLEAN: Specifies whether the selected option should be turned on or off. You can write TRUE to enable the option, and FALSE to disable it. The boolean value can also be omitted, in which case TRUE is assumed. STETEMENT MatrixOne supports any SELECT , UPDATE , DELETE statement execution plan. For INSERT statement, only INSERT INTO..SELECT is supported in 0.5.1 version. INSERT INTO...VALUES is not supported yet.

The execution plan shows how the table(s) referenced by the statement will be scanned \u2014 by plain sequential scan, index scan, and so on. \u2014 and if multiple tables are referenced, what join algorithms will be used to bring together the required rows from each input table. The most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in cost units that are arbitrary, but conventionally mean disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up cost before the first row can be returned, and the total cost to return all the rows. For most queries the total cost is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery in EXISTS , the planner will choose the smallest start-up cost instead of the smallest total cost (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with a LIMIT clause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest. The ANALYZE option causes the statement to be actually executed, not only planned. Then actual run time statistics are added to the display, including the total elapsed time expended within each plan node (in milliseconds) and the total number of rows it actually returned. This is useful for seeing whether the planner's estimates are close to reality.","title":"Description"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/Explain/explain/#parameters","text":"ANALYZE: Carry out the command and show actual run times and other statistics.

Statement names are not case-sensitive. Syntax PREPARE stmt_name FROM preparable_stmt Arguments Arguments Description stmt_name The name of the prepared statement. preparable_stmt a string literal or a user variable that contains the text of the SQL statement. The text must represent a single statement, not multiple statements. Within the statement, ? characters can be used as parameter markers to indicate where data values are to be bound to the query later when you execute it. The ? characters should not be enclosed within quotation marks, even if you intend to bind them to string values. Parameter markers can be used only where data values should appear, not for SQL keywords, identifiers, and so forth. If a prepared statement with the given name already exists, it is deallocated implicitly before the new statement is prepared. This means that if the new statement contains an error and cannot be prepared, an error is returned and no statement with the given name exists. The scope of a prepared statement is the session within which it is created, which as several implications: A prepared statement created in one session is not available to other sessions. When a session ends, whether normally or abnormally, its prepared statements no longer exist. If auto-reconnect is enabled, the client is not notified that the connection was lost. For this reason, clients may wish to disable auto-reconnect. A parameter used in a prepared statement has its type determined when the statement is first prepared, and retains this type whenever EXECUTE is invoked for this prepared statement. Rules for determining a parameter's type are listed here: A parameter which is an operand of a binary arithmetic operator has the same data type as the other operand. If both operands of a binary arithmetic operator are parameters, the type of the parameters is decided by the context of the operator. If a parameter is the operand of a unary arithmetic operator, the parameter's type is decided by the context of the operator. If an arithmetic operator has no type-determining context, the derived type for any parameters involved is DOUBLE PRECISION . This can happen, for example, when the parameter is a top-level node in a SELECT list, or when it is part of a comparison operator. A parameter which is an operand of a character string operator has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the other operands. If all operands of the operator are parameters, the derived type is VARCHAR; its collation is determined by the value of collation_connection . A parameter which is an operand of a temporal operator has type DATETIME if the operator returns a DATETIME , TIME if the operator returns a TIME , and DATE if the operator returns a DATE . A parameter which is an operand of a binary comparison operator has the same derived type as the other operand of the comparison. A parameter that is an operand of a ternary comparison operator such as BETWEEN has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the other operands. If all operands of a comparison operator are parameters, the derived type for each of them is VARCHAR , with collation determined by the value of collation_connection . A parameter that is an output operand of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF, IFNULL, or NULLIF has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the operator's other output operands. If all output operands of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF, IFNULL, or NULLIF are parameters, or they are all NULL, the type of the parameter is decided by the context of the operator. If the parameter is an operand of any of CASE, COALESCE(), IF, or IFNULL, and has no type-determining context, the derived type for each of the parameters involved is VARCHAR, and its collation is determined by the value of collation_connection. A parameter which is the operand of a CAST() has the same type as specified by the CAST(). If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is not part of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is VARCHAR, and its collation is determined by the value of collation_connection. If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is part of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type of the corresponding column into which the parameter is inserted. If a parameter is used as source for an assignment in a SET clause of an UPDATE statement or in the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type of the corresponding column which is updated by the SET or ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause. If a parameter is an argument of a function, the derived type depends on the function's return type. For some combinations of actual type and derived type, an automatic repreparation of the statement is triggered. Repreparation does not occur if any of the following conditions are true: NULL is used as the actual parameter value. A parameter is an operand of a CAST(). (Instead, a cast to the derived type is attempted, and an exception raised if the cast fails.) A parameter is a string. (In this case, an implicit CAST(? AS derived_type) is performed.) The derived type and actual type of the parameter are both INTEGER and have the same sign. The parameter's derived type is DECIMAL and its actual type is either DECIMAL or INTEGER. The derived type is DOUBLE and the actual type is any numeric type. Both the derived type and the actual type are string types. If the derived type is temporal and the actual type is temporal. Exceptions: The derived type is TIME and the actual type is not TIME; the derived type is DATE and the actual type is not DATE. The derived type is temporal and the actual type is numeric. For cases other than those just listed, the statement is reprepared and the actual parameter types are used instead of the derived parameter types. These rules also apply to a user variable referenced in a prepared statement. Using a different data type for a given parameter or user variable within a prepared statement for executions of the statement subsequent to the first execution causes the statement to be reprepared. This is less efficient; it may also lead to the parameter's (or variable's) actual type to vary, and thus for results to be inconsistent, with subsequent executions of the prepared statement. For these reasons, it is advisable to use the same data type for a given parameter when re-executing a prepared statement.

This article will introduce the purpose of sql_mode , standard modes, and how to set sql_mode . Why set sql_mode sql_mode can control the behavior of MatrixOne, including how to handle NULL values, perform insert operations, and sort and compare strings. It can ensure strict compliance with SQL standards and avoid non-standard behavior. In addition, sql_mode can help developers better identify errors and potential issues in SQL statements. Default modes of sql_mode The following are the standard modes of sql_mode , which are also the default modes in MatrixOne: ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY : The GROUP BY clause is used to group query results and perform aggregate calculations on each group, such as COUNT , SUM , AVG , etc. In the GROUP BY clause, the specified columns are the grouping columns. Other columns can be identified in the SELECT list, including aggregate or non-aggregate function columns. Without the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode, if a non-aggregate function column is set in the SELECT list, MatrixOne will select any value that matches the GROUP BY column use it to calculate the aggregate function by default. Note If your table structure is complex and for ease of querying, you can disable the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode. STRICT_TRANS_TABLES : When executing INSERT and UPDATE statements, an error will be reported if the data does not conform to the rules defined for the table. NO_ZERO_IN_DATE : Prohibits inserting zero values into fields of type DATE or DATETIME . NO_ZERO_DATE : Prohibits inserting or updating the field value of 0000-00-00 as a date or datetime type. The purpose of this mode is to avoid inserting invalid or illegal values into a date or datetime field and require the use of a valid date or datetime values. If such an operation is performed, an error will be reported. It should be noted that the NO_ZERO_DATE mode is only effective for insert or update operations. For existing 0000-00-00 values, they can still be queried and used. ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO : This mode throws an error when dividing by zero. NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION : This mode throws an error when executing ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statements. The purpose of this mode is to force the use of the specified storage engine, preventing data inconsistencies or performance issues. The specified storage engine is unavailable or does not exist instead of automatically substituting it with another available storage engine. If automatic substitution of storage engines is desired, this mode can be removed from the sql_mode or set to other supported sql_mode methods. It is important to note that this mode only applies to ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statements and does not affect the storage engine of existing tables. Optional modes for sql_mode ANSI : ANSI is a standard SQL language specification developed by ANSI (American National Standards Institute). In ANSI mode, SQL statements must comply with the ANSI SQL standard, which means that specific SQL language extensions or features specific to a particular database cannot be used. ALLOW_INVALID_DATES : ALLOW_INVALID_DATES , also known as \"loose mode\" in MatrixOne SQL mode, allows the insertion of invalid dates in standard date format, such as '0000-00-00' or '2000-00-00'. This mode exists to be compatible with some earlier versions of MySQL and non-standard date formats. It is important to note that inserting invalid dates in ALLOW_INVALID_DATES mode can cause unexpected behavior, as invalid dates will not be handled appropriately. Therefore, it is always recommended to use the standard date format. ANSI_QUOTES : ANSI_QUOTES is a strict mode in SQL mode, used to enforce SQL standards more strictly. In ANSI_QUOTES mode, MatrixOne treats double quotes as identifier quotes instead of string quotes. If you want to use double quotes to quote an identifier such as a table name or column name, you must use double quotes instead of single quotes. For example, the following SQL statement is correct in ANSI_QUOTES mode: SELECT \"column_name\" FROM \"table_name\" ; In the default SQL mode, double quotes will be interpreted as string quotes, resulting in incorrect syntax. Therefore, to use double quotes to quote identifiers, you must set MatrixOne to the ANSI_QUOTES mode. It should be noted that using the ANSI_QUOTES mode may cause SQL syntax incompatibility with other database systems because most other database systems use double quotes as string quotes rather than identifier quotes. Therefore, ANSI_QUOTES mode should be used cautiously when writing portable SQL statements. HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE : HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE is called the \"high-priority NOT operator\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE mode, MatrixOne treats the NOT operator as a high-priority operator, meaning its priority is higher than most other operators. This means that if you use both the NOT operator and other operators in an SQL statement, MatrixOne will first calculate the result of the NOT operator and then calculate the results of the other operators. For example: SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT column = 1 AND column2 = 'value' ; In HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE mode, MatrixOne will first calculate the result of NOT column = 1, and then calculate the result of column2 = 'value'. If the NOT operator is not correctly placed in the statement, it may result in unexpected results. It should be noted that in MatrixOne's default SQL mode, the NOT operator has the same priority as other operators. If you need to use the HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE mode, make sure to use parentheses in your SQL statements to clarify the priority. IGNORE_SPACE : IGNORE_SPACE is referred to as the \"ignore space\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In IGNORE_SPACE mode, MatrixOne ignores multiple spaces or tabs in an SQL statement and only considers one space or tab as a delimiter. This means that the following two SQL statements are equivalent in IGNORE_SPACE mode: SELECT * FROM my_table ; SELECT * FROM my_table ; The purpose of this mode is to make SQL statements more flexible and readable by allowing any number of spaces or tabs between keywords. However, it should be noted that in some cases, this mode may cause unexpected behavior, such as syntax errors when spaces or tabs are incorrectly placed in SQL functions or column names. By default, MatrixOne does not enable the IGNORE_SPACE mode. To enable this mode, you can use the SQL command SET sql_mode='IGNORE_SPACE' when connecting to MatrixOne. NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO : NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO is called the \"no auto value on zero\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode, when you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, MatrixOne does not treat it as an auto-increment value but as a regular 0 value. This means that if you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, the value of that column will not be automatically incremented but will remain 0 in NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode. For example, the following SQL statement will not auto-increment the id column in NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode: CREATE TABLE my_table ( id INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ); INSERT INTO my_table ( id , name ) VALUES ( 0 , 'John' ); In the default SQL mode, when you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, MatrixOne treats it as an auto-increment value and automatically increases it to the next available one. However, this may not be the desired behavior in some cases, so you can use the NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode to disable it. If you use the NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode, inserting data with a value of 0 may cause primary key duplicates or unique vital conflicts. So, extra attention is needed when you insert data. NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES : NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES is also known as \"no backslash escapes\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode, MatrixOne does not treat the backslash as an escape character. This means that you cannot use the backslash to escape special characters, such as quotes or percent signs, in SQL statements. Instead, if you need to use these special characters in SQL statements, you must use other methods to escape them, such as using single quotes to represent double quotes in strings. For example, the following SQL statement will cause a syntax error in NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode: SELECT 'It' s a nice day ' FROM my_table ; In the default SQL mode, MatrixOne allows backslashes to escape special characters, so backslashes can be used in SQL statements to run characters such as quotes and percent signs. However, in some cases, using backslash escapes may result in confusion or incorrect results, so the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode can be used to prohibit this behavior. If you use the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode, you must use other ways to escape special characters, which may make SQL statements more complex and difficult to understand. Therefore, it's necessary to consider when using this mode carefully. NO_DIR_IN_CREATE : known as \"no directory in create\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode, prohibits directory paths in CREATE TABLE statements. In the NO_DIR_IN_CREATE mode, MatrixOne will report an error when a directory path is used in the column definition of a CREATE TABLE statement, which includes a way that contains a file name. For example: CREATE TABLE my_table ( id INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , datafile '/var/lib/MatrixOne/my_table_data.dat' , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ); In the SQL statement above, the datafile column defines a path containing a file name, specifying the file storing table data. In the NO_DIR_IN_CREATE mode, MatrixOne does not allow the use of such directory paths in CREATE TABLE statements and requires that the file path and file name be defined separately, for example: CREATE TABLE my_table ( id INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , datafile VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ) DATA DIRECTORY '/var/lib/MatrixOne/' INDEX DIRECTORY '/var/lib/MatrixOne/' ; The data file column in the SQL statement above only defines the file name. In contrast, the file path is defined separately in the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clauses of the CREATE TABLE statement. It should be noted that the NO_DIR_IN_CREATE mode does not affect column definitions in already created tables but only affects column definitions in CREATE TABLE statements. Therefore, when using this mode, you'll need careful consideration to ensure your SQL statements meet its requirements. NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION : NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION is also also known as \"no unsigned subtraction\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode, treats the result of the subtraction of unsigned integers with the subtraction operator (-) as a signed integer instead of an unsigned integer. This means that if the value of the unsigned integer is smaller than the subtrahend, the result will be a negative number instead of an unsigned integer. For example: SET SQL_MODE = 'NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION' ; SELECT CAST ( 1 AS UNSIGNED ) - CAST ( 2 AS UNSIGNED ); In the SQL statement above, the NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION mode treats CAST(1 AS UNSIGNED) - CAST(2 AS UNSIGNED) as a signed integer operation, so the result is -1 instead of the result of an unsigned integer operation, which is 4294967295. It should be noted that the NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION mode only affects unsigned integers that are subtracted using the subtraction operator (-), and other operations that use unsigned integers are not affected. If you need to perform many unsigned integer operations in MatrixOne, using appropriate type conversions in your code is recommended to avoid potential errors. PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH : PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH is called the \"pad CHAR to full length\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode, when you define a column of CHAR type, MatrixOne pads the column's value with spaces to make its length equal to the length specified for the column. This is because in MatrixOne, a column of CHAR type always occupies the defined length when stored, and any shortfall is filled with spaces. However, by default, the character set used by MatrixOne may be a multi-byte character set, so if spaces are used for padding, it may lead to incorrect length calculation. In the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode, MatrixOne uses the maximum character length of the character set to pad the column of CHAR type to ensure that the length it occupies matches the defined size. This can avoid the problem of length calculation errors when using multi-byte character sets, but it also increases the use of storage space. It should be noted that the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode only affects columns of CHAR type and does not affect columns of other varieties. If you need to use CHAR type columns in MatrixOne and correctly calculate the length of column values in a multi-byte character set, you can consider using the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode. PIPES_AS_CONCAT : PIPES_AS_CONCAT is called the \"pipes as concatenation\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In the PIPES_AS_CONCAT mode, MatrixOne treats the vertical bar symbol (|) as a string concatenation rather than a bitwise operator. If you use the standing bar symbol to concatenate two strings, MatrixOne will treat them as one string instead of interpreting them as a binary bit operation. For example, the following SQL statement will return an error in the default mode because MatrixOne treats the vertical bar symbol as a bitwise operator: SELECT 'abc' | 'def' ; However, if the SQL mode is set to PIPES_AS_CONCAT , the above SQL statement will return the string 'abcdef'. Note that if your SQL statement contains the vertical bar symbol and it should be treated as a bitwise operator, do not use the PIPES_AS_CONCAT mode. Conversely, if you need to treat the vertical bar symbol as a string concatenation operator, use the PIPES_AS_CONCAT mode. REAL_AS_FLOAT : REAL_AS_FLOAT is known as \"treat REAL type as FLOAT type\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In REAL_AS_FLOAT mode, MatrixOne treats data of the REAL type as data of the FLOAT type. This means that MatrixOne uses the storage format of the FLOAT type to store data of the REAL type, rather than the more precise but also more space-consuming DOUBLE type storage format. Note that since the storage format of FLOAT type data occupies less space than DOUBLE type data, treating data of the REAL type as data of the FLOAT type can save storage space in some cases. However, doing so will also reduce the precision of the data, as FLOAT type data can only provide about 7 significant digits of precision, while DOUBLE type data can provide about 15 significant digits of precision. If you need to store high-precision floating-point data in MatrixOne, it is recommended not to use the REAL_AS_FLOAT mode and use DOUBLE type data to store it. If you do not require high data precision, you may consider using the REAL_AS_FLOAT mode to save storage space. STRICT_ALL_TABLES : STRICT_ALL_TABLES is known as \"enable strict mode\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In STRICT_ALL_TABLES mode, MatrixOne enables a series of strict checks to ensure that insert, update, and delete operations comply with constraints such as data types, NULL values, and foreign keys. Specifically, STRICT_ALL_TABLES mode performs the following operations: a. Rejects illegal values from being inserted into any column. b. Rejects NULL values from being inserted into non-NULL columns. c. Rejects values outside the allowed range from being inserted into any column. d. Rejects strings from being inserted into numeric type columns. e. Rejects date or time strings from being inserted into non-date or time type columns. f. Rejects values that exceed the length defined for CHAR , VARCHAR , and TEXT type columns from being inserted. g. Rejects values with mismatched data types from being inserted into foreign key columns. Note that enabling strict mode may cause problems for some old applications as they may assume that MatrixOne does not perform mandatory constraint checks. If you encounter problems when updating or migrating applications, consider disabling strict mode or modifying the application to comply with strict mode requirements. TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL : TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL is known as \"truncate fractional part of time\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL mode, MatrixOne truncates the fractional part of data of the TIME , DATETIME , and TIMESTAMP types, retaining only the integer part. This means that if you insert time data with a fractional part into a column of the TIME , DATETIME , or TIMESTAMP type, MatrixOne will truncate the fractional part and set it to 0. Note that enabling the TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL mode may cause some loss of data precision, as truncating the fractional part may lose some critical time information. If you need to store and manipulate accurate time data, it is recommended not to use the TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL mode. TRADITIONAL : TRADITIONAL is a type of schema in the MatrixOne SQL mode, also known as the \"traditional\" mode. In TRADITIONAL mode, MatrixOne enables a series of strict checks to ensure that insert, update, and delete operations conform to SQL standard constraints. Specifically, the TRADITIONA L mode performs the following operations: a. Enables STRICT_TRANS_TABLES and STRICT_ALL_TABLES modes. b. Rejects INSERT statements that omit column names to ensure all columns are explicitly assigned values. c. Rejects inserting values with unclear data types into foreign key columns. d. Rejects inserting strings into numeric columns. e. Rejects inserting date or time strings into non-date or time-type columns. f. Rejects inserting values that exceed the defined length of CHAR , VARCHAR , and TEXT columns. g. Rejects using non-aggregate columns in the GROUP BY clause. h. Rejects using non-listed non-aggregate columns in the SELECT statement. i. It should be noted that enabling traditional mode may cause issues with some older applications that assume MatrixOne will not perform mandatory constraint checks. If you encounter problems when updating or migrating applications, consider the traditional disabling mode or modifying the applications to comply with traditional mode requirements. How to set sql_mode The sql_mode can be set using the SET statement, for example: SET sql_mode = 'STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY' ; The sql_mode can also be set in the configuration file of MatrixOne, for example: sql_mode = STRICT_TRANS_TABLES , NO_ZERO_IN_DATE , ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY ; In the example settings above, MatrixOne will use the STRICT_TRANS_TABLES , NO_ZERO_IN_DATE , and ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY modes.

Other columns can be identified in the SELECT list, including aggregate or non-aggregate function columns. Without the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode, if a non-aggregate function column is set in the SELECT list, MatrixOne will select any value that matches the GROUP BY column use it to calculate the aggregate function by default. Note If your table structure is complex and for ease of querying, you can disable the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode. STRICT_TRANS_TABLES : When executing INSERT and UPDATE statements, an error will be reported if the data does not conform to the rules defined for the table. NO_ZERO_IN_DATE : Prohibits inserting zero values into fields of type DATE or DATETIME . NO_ZERO_DATE : Prohibits inserting or updating the field value of 0000-00-00 as a date or datetime type. The purpose of this mode is to avoid inserting invalid or illegal values into a date or datetime field and require the use of a valid date or datetime values. If such an operation is performed, an error will be reported. It should be noted that the NO_ZERO_DATE mode is only effective for insert or update operations. For existing 0000-00-00 values, they can still be queried and used. ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO : This mode throws an error when dividing by zero. NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION : This mode throws an error when executing ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statements. The purpose of this mode is to force the use of the specified storage engine, preventing data inconsistencies or performance issues. The specified storage engine is unavailable or does not exist instead of automatically substituting it with another available storage engine. If automatic substitution of storage engines is desired, this mode can be removed from the sql_mode or set to other supported sql_mode methods. It is important to note that this mode only applies to ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statements and does not affect the storage engine of existing tables.","title":"Default modes of sql_mode"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/sql-mode/#optional-modes-for-sql_mode","text":"ANSI : ANSI is a standard SQL language specification developed by ANSI (American National Standards Institute). In ANSI mode, SQL statements must comply with the ANSI SQL standard, which means that specific SQL language extensions or features specific to a particular database cannot be used. ALLOW_INVALID_DATES : ALLOW_INVALID_DATES , also known as \"loose mode\" in MatrixOne SQL mode, allows the insertion of invalid dates in standard date format, such as '0000-00-00' or '2000-00-00'. This mode exists to be compatible with some earlier versions of MySQL and non-standard date formats. It is important to note that inserting invalid dates in ALLOW_INVALID_DATES mode can cause unexpected behavior, as invalid dates will not be handled appropriately. Therefore, it is always recommended to use the standard date format. ANSI_QUOTES : ANSI_QUOTES is a strict mode in SQL mode, used to enforce SQL standards more strictly. In ANSI_QUOTES mode, MatrixOne treats double quotes as identifier quotes instead of string quotes. If you want to use double quotes to quote an identifier such as a table name or column name, you must use double quotes instead of single quotes. For example, the following SQL statement is correct in ANSI_QUOTES mode: SELECT \"column_name\" FROM \"table_name\" ; In the default SQL mode, double quotes will be interpreted as string quotes, resulting in incorrect syntax. Therefore, to use double quotes to quote identifiers, you must set MatrixOne to the ANSI_QUOTES mode. It should be noted that using the ANSI_QUOTES mode may cause SQL syntax incompatibility with other database systems because most other database systems use double quotes as string quotes rather than identifier quotes. Therefore, ANSI_QUOTES mode should be used cautiously when writing portable SQL statements. HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE : HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE is called the \"high-priority NOT operator\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE mode, MatrixOne treats the NOT operator as a high-priority operator, meaning its priority is higher than most other operators. This means that if you use both the NOT operator and other operators in an SQL statement, MatrixOne will first calculate the result of the NOT operator and then calculate the results of the other operators. For example: SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT column = 1 AND column2 = 'value' ; In HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE mode, MatrixOne will first calculate the result of NOT column = 1, and then calculate the result of column2 = 'value'. If the NOT operator is not correctly placed in the statement, it may result in unexpected results. It should be noted that in MatrixOne's default SQL mode, the NOT operator has the same priority as other operators. If you need to use the HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE mode, make sure to use parentheses in your SQL statements to clarify the priority. IGNORE_SPACE : IGNORE_SPACE is referred to as the \"ignore space\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In IGNORE_SPACE mode, MatrixOne ignores multiple spaces or tabs in an SQL statement and only considers one space or tab as a delimiter. This means that the following two SQL statements are equivalent in IGNORE_SPACE mode: SELECT * FROM my_table ; SELECT * FROM my_table ; The purpose of this mode is to make SQL statements more flexible and readable by allowing any number of spaces or tabs between keywords. However, it should be noted that in some cases, this mode may cause unexpected behavior, such as syntax errors when spaces or tabs are incorrectly placed in SQL functions or column names. By default, MatrixOne does not enable the IGNORE_SPACE mode. To enable this mode, you can use the SQL command SET sql_mode='IGNORE_SPACE' when connecting to MatrixOne. NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO : NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO is called the \"no auto value on zero\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode, when you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, MatrixOne does not treat it as an auto-increment value but as a regular 0 value. This means that if you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, the value of that column will not be automatically incremented but will remain 0 in NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode. For example, the following SQL statement will not auto-increment the id column in NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode: CREATE TABLE my_table ( id INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ); INSERT INTO my_table ( id , name ) VALUES ( 0 , 'John' ); In the default SQL mode, when you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, MatrixOne treats it as an auto-increment value and automatically increases it to the next available one. However, this may not be the desired behavior in some cases, so you can use the NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode to disable it. If you use the NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO mode, inserting data with a value of 0 may cause primary key duplicates or unique vital conflicts. So, extra attention is needed when you insert data. NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES : NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES is also known as \"no backslash escapes\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode, MatrixOne does not treat the backslash as an escape character. This means that you cannot use the backslash to escape special characters, such as quotes or percent signs, in SQL statements. Instead, if you need to use these special characters in SQL statements, you must use other methods to escape them, such as using single quotes to represent double quotes in strings. For example, the following SQL statement will cause a syntax error in NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode: SELECT 'It' s a nice day ' FROM my_table ; In the default SQL mode, MatrixOne allows backslashes to escape special characters, so backslashes can be used in SQL statements to run characters such as quotes and percent signs. However, in some cases, using backslash escapes may result in confusion or incorrect results, so the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode can be used to prohibit this behavior. If you use the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode, you must use other ways to escape special characters, which may make SQL statements more complex and difficult to understand. Therefore, it's necessary to consider when using this mode carefully. NO_DIR_IN_CREATE : known as \"no directory in create\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode, prohibits directory paths in CREATE TABLE statements. In the NO_DIR_IN_CREATE mode, MatrixOne will report an error when a directory path is used in the column definition of a CREATE TABLE statement, which includes a way that contains a file name. For example: CREATE TABLE my_table ( id INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , datafile '/var/lib/MatrixOne/my_table_data.dat' , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ); In the SQL statement above, the datafile column defines a path containing a file name, specifying the file storing table data. In the NO_DIR_IN_CREATE mode, MatrixOne does not allow the use of such directory paths in CREATE TABLE statements and requires that the file path and file name be defined separately, for example: CREATE TABLE my_table ( id INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , datafile VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ) DATA DIRECTORY '/var/lib/MatrixOne/' INDEX DIRECTORY '/var/lib/MatrixOne/' ; The data file column in the SQL statement above only defines the file name. In contrast, the file path is defined separately in the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clauses of the CREATE TABLE statement. It should be noted that the NO_DIR_IN_CREATE mode does not affect column definitions in already created tables but only affects column definitions in CREATE TABLE statements. Therefore, when using this mode, you'll need careful consideration to ensure your SQL statements meet its requirements. NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION : NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION is also also known as \"no unsigned subtraction\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode, treats the result of the subtraction of unsigned integers with the subtraction operator (-) as a signed integer instead of an unsigned integer. This means that if the value of the unsigned integer is smaller than the subtrahend, the result will be a negative number instead of an unsigned integer. For example: SET SQL_MODE = 'NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION' ; SELECT CAST ( 1 AS UNSIGNED ) - CAST ( 2 AS UNSIGNED ); In the SQL statement above, the NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION mode treats CAST(1 AS UNSIGNED) - CAST(2 AS UNSIGNED) as a signed integer operation, so the result is -1 instead of the result of an unsigned integer operation, which is 4294967295. It should be noted that the NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION mode only affects unsigned integers that are subtracted using the subtraction operator (-), and other operations that use unsigned integers are not affected. If you need to perform many unsigned integer operations in MatrixOne, using appropriate type conversions in your code is recommended to avoid potential errors. PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH : PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH is called the \"pad CHAR to full length\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode, when you define a column of CHAR type, MatrixOne pads the column's value with spaces to make its length equal to the length specified for the column. This is because in MatrixOne, a column of CHAR type always occupies the defined length when stored, and any shortfall is filled with spaces. However, by default, the character set used by MatrixOne may be a multi-byte character set, so if spaces are used for padding, it may lead to incorrect length calculation. In the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode, MatrixOne uses the maximum character length of the character set to pad the column of CHAR type to ensure that the length it occupies matches the defined size. This can avoid the problem of length calculation errors when using multi-byte character sets, but it also increases the use of storage space. It should be noted that the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode only affects columns of CHAR type and does not affect columns of other varieties. If you need to use CHAR type columns in MatrixOne and correctly calculate the length of column values in a multi-byte character set, you can consider using the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH mode. PIPES_AS_CONCAT : PIPES_AS_CONCAT is called the \"pipes as concatenation\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In the PIPES_AS_CONCAT mode, MatrixOne treats the vertical bar symbol (|) as a string concatenation rather than a bitwise operator. If you use the standing bar symbol to concatenate two strings, MatrixOne will treat them as one string instead of interpreting them as a binary bit operation. For example, the following SQL statement will return an error in the default mode because MatrixOne treats the vertical bar symbol as a bitwise operator: SELECT 'abc' | 'def' ; However, if the SQL mode is set to PIPES_AS_CONCAT , the above SQL statement will return the string 'abcdef'. Note that if your SQL statement contains the vertical bar symbol and it should be treated as a bitwise operator, do not use the PIPES_AS_CONCAT mode. Conversely, if you need to treat the vertical bar symbol as a string concatenation operator, use the PIPES_AS_CONCAT mode. REAL_AS_FLOAT : REAL_AS_FLOAT is known as \"treat REAL type as FLOAT type\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In REAL_AS_FLOAT mode, MatrixOne treats data of the REAL type as data of the FLOAT type. This means that MatrixOne uses the storage format of the FLOAT type to store data of the REAL type, rather than the more precise but also more space-consuming DOUBLE type storage format. Note that since the storage format of FLOAT type data occupies less space than DOUBLE type data, treating data of the REAL type as data of the FLOAT type can save storage space in some cases. However, doing so will also reduce the precision of the data, as FLOAT type data can only provide about 7 significant digits of precision, while DOUBLE type data can provide about 15 significant digits of precision. If you need to store high-precision floating-point data in MatrixOne, it is recommended not to use the REAL_AS_FLOAT mode and use DOUBLE type data to store it. If you do not require high data precision, you may consider using the REAL_AS_FLOAT mode to save storage space. STRICT_ALL_TABLES : STRICT_ALL_TABLES is known as \"enable strict mode\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In STRICT_ALL_TABLES mode, MatrixOne enables a series of strict checks to ensure that insert, update, and delete operations comply with constraints such as data types, NULL values, and foreign keys. Specifically, STRICT_ALL_TABLES mode performs the following operations: a. Rejects illegal values from being inserted into any column. b. Rejects NULL values from being inserted into non-NULL columns. c. Rejects values outside the allowed range from being inserted into any column. d. Rejects strings from being inserted into numeric type columns. e. Rejects date or time strings from being inserted into non-date or time type columns. f. Rejects values that exceed the length defined for CHAR , VARCHAR , and TEXT type columns from being inserted. g. Rejects values with mismatched data types from being inserted into foreign key columns. Note that enabling strict mode may cause problems for some old applications as they may assume that MatrixOne does not perform mandatory constraint checks. If you encounter problems when updating or migrating applications, consider disabling strict mode or modifying the application to comply with strict mode requirements. TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL : TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL is known as \"truncate fractional part of time\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL mode, MatrixOne truncates the fractional part of data of the TIME , DATETIME , and TIMESTAMP types, retaining only the integer part. This means that if you insert time data with a fractional part into a column of the TIME , DATETIME , or TIMESTAMP type, MatrixOne will truncate the fractional part and set it to 0. Note that enabling the TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL mode may cause some loss of data precision, as truncating the fractional part may lose some critical time information. If you need to store and manipulate accurate time data, it is recommended not to use the TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL mode. TRADITIONAL : TRADITIONAL is a type of schema in the MatrixOne SQL mode, also known as the \"traditional\" mode. In TRADITIONAL mode, MatrixOne enables a series of strict checks to ensure that insert, update, and delete operations conform to SQL standard constraints. Specifically, the TRADITIONA L mode performs the following operations: a. Enables STRICT_TRANS_TABLES and STRICT_ALL_TABLES modes. b. Rejects INSERT statements that omit column names to ensure all columns are explicitly assigned values. c. Rejects inserting values with unclear data types into foreign key columns. d. Rejects inserting strings into numeric columns. e. Rejects inserting date or time strings into non-date or time-type columns. f. Rejects inserting values that exceed the defined length of CHAR , VARCHAR , and TEXT columns. g. Rejects using non-aggregate columns in the GROUP BY clause. h. Rejects using non-listed non-aggregate columns in the SELECT statement. i. It should be noted that enabling traditional mode may cause issues with some older applications that assume MatrixOne will not perform mandatory constraint checks. If you encounter problems when updating or migrating applications, consider the traditional disabling mode or modifying the applications to comply with traditional mode requirements.","title":"Optional modes for sql_mode"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/sql-mode/#how-to-set-sql_mode","text":"The sql_mode can be set using the SET statement, for example: SET sql_mode = 'STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY' ; The sql_mode can also be set in the configuration file of MatrixOne, for example: sql_mode = STRICT_TRANS_TABLES , NO_ZERO_IN_DATE , ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY ; In the example settings above, MatrixOne will use the STRICT_TRANS_TABLES , NO_ZERO_IN_DATE , and ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY modes.","title":"How to set sql_mode"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/sql-mode/#constraints","text":"MatrixOne is compatible with MySQL, except the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode; other modes of sql_mode only implement syntax support.","title":"Constraints"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/system-variables-overview/","text":"Server System Variables MatrixOne server system variables are variables used to control or configure the behavior of the database engine or other components in the MatrixOne server.

Global variables : Global variables apply to all connected sessions of the MatrixOne server. Their values are set when the MatrixOne server starts and remain unchanged until the server is shut down. Global variables are typically used to control the behavior of the MatrixOne server, such as specifying default backup and restore locations, the default language environment, and so on. Session variables : Session variables apply only to the currently connected user's session of the MatrixOne server. Their values can be changed anytime during the user's connection and are automatically cleared when the user disconnects.

In this release, MatrixOne version 0.7.0 has been optimized for stability and performance under a cloud-native architecture and complete database functionality. To improve stability, we have optimized the memory management mechanism to significantly reduce the likelihood of memory leaks. We have also adjusted the timeout mechanism of some modules to prevent the system from becoming unresponsive during extreme cases, such as data import and restart. Additionally, we have fixed the issue where a single module failure in the distributed architecture would cause a system-wide collapse. To enhance performance, this iteration has focused on read and write optimization. For reading, we have implemented Zonemap-based statistical information and provided a better execution plan. We have also added the Cluster by field when creating a table to arrange data in advance, making it easier to obtain data faster. Furthermore, we have optimized many performance bottlenecks, including the IN operator, type conversion, and predicate filtering. As for writing, this iteration has achieved many parallel writes to shared storage directly through the CN node, greatly improving loading performance.

After four months of intensive development, MatrixOne has achieved significant performance, scalability, and usability enhancements. This update's highlight is the Proxy module's introduction, which accurately associates various SQL requests and load types with corresponding CN groups. This results in notable improvements in critical functions such as tenant isolation, read-write separation, and separation of transaction processing (TP) and analytical processing (AP) loads.

Docker General Image: docker pull matrixorigin/matrixone:0.8.0 If you are using the network in mainland China, you can pull the image on Alibaba Cloud: docker pull registry.cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/matrixorigin/matrixone:0.8.0 Key Points Performance OLTP Performance: In common OLTP scenarios such as point queries and insertions, MatrixOne's performance has improved several times, reaching the performance level of MySQL in the standalone version. OLAP Performance: MatrixOne has further improved its OLAP performance. Standard OLAP benchmarks such as TPCH are comparable to the performance of leading OLAP databases in the industry. Scalability: MatrixOne implements second-level expansion of CN computing nodes, and after expansion, the performance of OLTP and OLAP increases linearly. Improved Usability Backward Compatibility of Data Format: Starting from version 0.8.0, all subsequent versions of MatrixOne will be compatible with the underlying data storage format of version 0.8.0. When upgrading the version, you no longer need to delete or re-import the old data directory. Simplified Deployment and Administration Tools: This iteration provides a simplified deployment and administration command-line tool, mo_ctl , which helps users quickly check the basic hardware environment, initialize configurations, and perform one-click installation and deployment. Both standalone and distributed version users no longer need to use complex Linux and K8s native commands for deployment and maintenance. Improved MySQL Compatibility: An upper and lower case mode compatible with MySQL has been added, and a tool for converting SQL from MySQL to MatrixOne is provided. Additionally, MatrixOne has added many table structures in the information_schema library, significantly reducing the adaptation work required for migration from MySQL. Support for Pessimistic Transactions: To better adapt to the current OLTP application transaction usage habits, MatrixOne has added support for pessimistic transactions. Also, MatrixOne supports SI and RC isolation levels. There is no need to set a retry mechanism for potential conflicts arising from optimistic transactions. At the same time, MatrixOne has added support for the Select for update command. (Experimental) Other Features Support window function RANK() , ROW_NUMBER() and DENSE_RANK() . Support the BINARY type and related functions. Support data sharing between tenants and PUBLISH / SUBSCRIBE functions. Support INSERT...ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statement. Add Sequence and related statements. Support ADD [COLUMN] | DROP [COLUMN] in the ALTER TABLE statement. Support multi-layer foreign key. Support RAND() built-in function. Support setting global variables in configuration files. Secure initial MatrixOne account by password replacement. Several types of partitioning are supported. (Experimental) Known Issues Data formats of versions before 0.8.0 are incompatible and cannot be upgraded directly. Secondary indexes have not been improved in any performance. Occasional memory leaks may lead to system out-of-memory(OOM) errors. Workload isolation tags are currently only supported in JDBC. DN represents a single point of failure for distributed version. Occasional system hang-ups under high-concurrency workloads. Pessimistic transaction has a few fatal bugs remaining.

Currently, MatrixOne only supports username-password authentication. The database verifies the identity of the user accessing the data, confirms whether the user can be associated with a database user, and checks the validity of the provided password. Syntax In MatrixOne, a user's login identity comprises acccount_name , user_name , host , and password . The complete syntax is as follows: mysql -h host -p password -u accountname:username -P port The -h , -p , and -P parameters are the same as those used in MySQL. The difference lies in: -u represents the user. In MatrixOne's user system, users are a concept below the tenant account . Therefore, when logging in, you need to specify the tenant account_name first and then specify the user username within the tenant to complete the login. If account_name is not specified, the default is the system tenant sys . Example: > mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P6001 -utenant1:u1 -p111 Note For the standalone version of MatrixOne, you can configure the connection string as parameters in the mo_ctl tool to simplify the login process.

Overview MatrixOne uses non-encrypted transmission by default and supports encrypted transmission based on TLS protocol. Encrypted transmission can reduce the risk of leakage of sensitive information in the database. Encrypted transmission is the process of encrypting and decrypting information using keys, which can effectively protect data security. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely adopted security protocol. The protocol versions supported by MatrixOne include TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2. Do not enable TLS encrypted transmission (default): Use the username and password to connect to MatrixOne directly. Use encrypted transmission: It is necessary to enable encrypted transmission support on the MatrixOne server and specify the use of encrypted transmission on the client side. You can follow the instructions in this article to enable TLS secure connections. How to Use Main steps of TLS secure connection configuration : First, enable TLS in MatrixOne. Then, configure the MySQL client security connection parameters. After completing the configuration of these two main steps, a TLS secure connection can be established. Step 1: Enable MatrixOne's TLS support Generate certificate and key: MatrixOne does not yet support loading a private key protected by a password, so a private key file without a password must be provided. Certificates and keys can be issued and generated using OpenSSL. It is recommended to use the tool mysql_ssl_rsa_setup that comes with MySQL to generate quickly: #Check your local MySQL client installation directory ps -ef|grep mysql #Go to the installation directory of your local MySQL client cd /usr/local/mysql/bin #Generate certificate and key ./mysql_ssl_rsa_setup --datadir=<yourpath> #Check your generated pem file ls <yourpath> \u251c\u2500\u2500 ca-key.pem \u251c\u2500\u2500 ca.pem \u251c\u2500\u2500 client-cert.pem \u251c\u2500\u2500 client-key.pem \u251c\u2500\u2500 private_key.pem \u251c\u2500\u2500 public_key.pem \u251c\u2500\u2500 server-cert.pem \u2514\u2500\u2500 server-key.pem Note : <yourpath> in the above code is the local directory path where you need to store the generated certificate and key files. Enter the cn.toml configuration file in your local MatrixOne file directory path matrixone/etc/launch-tae-CN-tae-DN/ : You can also use the vim command to open the cn. toml file directly in the terminal vim $matrixone/etc/launch-tae-CN-tae-DN/cn.toml Copy and paste the code below into the configuration file: [cn.frontend] #default is false.

After logging in to the database, it registers all users' database operations and major internal events. It is also one of the essential features of many enterprise databases. In daily database operation and maintenance, an audit is a very effective means to ensure that all behaviors of database users comply with the law. When important events occur in the database, such as start and stop, node breakdown, and so on., the audit content can be very convenient for tracing the behavior of the protective device library before and after the period. It is necessary to enable database audit when you need to effectively and completely monitor necessary service information tables or system configuration tables. For example, it monitors all user A's behaviors in the database to discover the source of data modification or deletion promptly. For the monitoring of major internal events in the database, the fault can be rectified immediately, and the root cause of the accident can be traced back. MatrixOne supports auditing user behavior, operation logs, and SQL statements. The audit data of MatrixOne is stored in the database table, and the audit data can be queried directly through SQL interaction.

After logging in to the database, it registers all users' database operations and major internal events. It is also one of the essential features of many enterprise databases. In daily database operation and maintenance, an audit is a very effective means to ensure that all behaviors of database users comply with the law. When important events occur in the database, such as start and stop, node breakdown, and so on., the audit content can be very convenient for tracing the behavior of the protective device library before and after the period. It is necessary to enable database audit when you need to effectively and completely monitor necessary service information tables or system configuration tables. For example, it monitors all user A's behaviors in the database to discover the source of data modification or deletion promptly. For the monitoring of major internal events in the database, the fault can be rectified immediately, and the root cause of the accident can be traced back.

Steps Step 1: Create a new account Log into MatrixOne with the cluster administrator's username (root by default) and password: mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -u root -p Create a new account a1 ; the username and password of account a1 are: admin, test123: create account a1 ADMIN_NAME 'admin' IDENTIFIED BY 'test123'; Check all accounts information in the cluster (only root can view): mysql> select * from mo_catalog.mo_account; +------------+--------------+--------+---------------------+----------------+----------------+ | account_id | account_name | status | created_time | comments | suspended_time | +------------+--------------+--------+---------------------+----------------+----------------+ | 1 | a1 | open | 2022-12-19 14:47:19 | | NULL | | 0 | sys | open | 2022-12-07 11:00:58 | system account | NULL | +------------+--------------+--------+---------------------+----------------+----------------+ Step 2: Log in to the new account account, create users, create roles and grant the privilege You can reopen a new session with admin login to account a1 : mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -u a1:admin -p Now you can check the default users and roles under the account as a1 : mysql> select * from mo_catalog.mo_role; +---------+--------------+---------+-------+---------------------+----------+ | role_id | role_name | creator | owner | created_time | comments | +---------+--------------+---------+-------+---------------------+----------+ | 2 | accountadmin | 0 | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | | | 1 | public | 0 | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | | +---------+--------------+---------+-------+---------------------+----------+ 2 rows in set (0.01 sec) mysql> select * from mo_catalog.mo_user; +---------+-----------+-----------+-----------------------+--------+---------------------+--------------+------------+---------+-------+--------------+ | user_id | user_host | user_name | authentication_string | status | created_time | expired_time | login_type | creator | owner | default_role | +---------+-----------+-----------+-----------------------+--------+---------------------+--------------+------------+---------+-------+--------------+ | 2 | localhost | admin | test123 | unlock | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | NULL | PASSWORD | 0 | 0 | 2 | +---------+-----------+-----------+-----------------------+--------+---------------------+--------------+------------+---------+-------+--------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) After account a1 is successfully created, it has account administrator privileges by default so that you can view the system table information under account a1. In the mo_user table, it can be observed that there is currently a user account named admin , which is specified when creating a account; in addition, there are two default roles, accountadmin and public : accountadmin has the highest authority of the account, and the account named admin is granted by default; The system will authorize the public role for each new ordinary user by default, and the initial permission of the public role is connect , that is, to connect to MatrixOne. In addition, you can also view the privilege sets of these default roles in the system table: mysql> select * from mo_catalog.mo_role_privs; +---------+--------------+----------+--------+--------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------------------+ | role_id | role_name | obj_type | obj_id | privilege_id | privilege_name | privilege_level | operation_user_id | granted_time | with_grant_option | +---------+--------------+----------+--------+--------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------------------+ | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 3 | create user | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 4 | drop user | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 5 | alter user | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 6 | create role | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 7 | drop role | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 9 | create database | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 10 | drop database | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 11 | show databases | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 12 | connect | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 13 | manage grants | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | account | 0 | 14 | account all | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 18 | show tables | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 20 | create table | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 23 | drop table | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 26 | alter table | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 21 | create view | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 24 | drop view | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 27 | alter view | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 28 | database all | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | database | 0 | 29 | database ownership | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 30 | select | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 31 | insert | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 32 | update | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 33 | truncate | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 34 | delete | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 35 | reference | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 36 | index | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 37 | table all | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 38 | table ownership | *.* | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 2 | accountadmin | table | 0 | 41 | values | t | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | | 1 | public | account | 0 | 12 | connect | * | 0 | 2022-12-19 14:47:20 | true | +---------+--------------+----------+--------+--------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------------------+ In account a1 , create a new user and role: Username and password for user u1 are: u1, user123 Username and password for user u2 are: u2, user456 Role r1 is named: r1 Role r2 is named: r2 create user u1 identified by 'user123'; create user u2 identified by 'user456'; create role r1; create role r2; Create database db1 and create table t1 in db1 : create database db1; create table db1.t1(c1 int,c2 varchar); Grant select privilege on db1.t1 to r1 and insert privilege to r2 : grant select on table db1.t1 to r1; grant insert on table db1.t1 to r2; Grant role r1 to user u1 ; grant role r2 to user u2 : grant r1 to u1; grant r2 to u2; At this point, the newly created user, role, and object permission relationship is shown in the following figure: Step 3: Verify the privilege is valid Log in to account a1 with users u1 and u2 , respectively, to verify that the privileges are in effect.

When there are multiple users in a database or cluster unit, privilege management ensures that users only access authorized help, and granting users the principle of least authority can reduce enterprise information security risks. MatrixOne can also implement multi-account solutions through rights management. In MatrixOne, the data or resources owned by each account in the cluster are safely isolated, and users across cluster units cannot access the help of other cluster units. Only users authorized to access resources in the cluster have the right to access this A resource within a cluster unit. Privilege Management Features MatrixOne's privilege management is designed and implemented by combining two security models: RBAC (Role-based access control) and discretionary access control (DAC, Discretionary access control). These two security models are neutral access. The control mechanism mainly revolves around role and authority authorization strategies. It not only ensures data access security but also provides flexible and convenient management methods for database operation and maintenance personnel. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) : assign privileges to roles, and then assign roles to users. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) : Every object has an owner who can set and grant access privileges to that object. Key Concepts Object In MatrixOne, the privileges are encapsulated in an entity, which is object to facilitate the management of multiple operation privileges. For example, operation privileges such as Select , Insert , and Update is encapsulated in the Table object. For more information about object privileges, please refer to MatrixOne Privilege Control Types . Relationship between objects As shown in the diagram below: from above, higher-level objects can create (or delete) lower-level objects. The hierarchical relationships in the above figure are all 1:n relationships; that is, multiple accounts can be created in one cluster, multiple users and roles can be created under one account, and multiple tables and views can be created in one database. In MatrixOne, although the operation privileges in each object are independent of each other (for example, the SHOW TABLES privilege in the Database object is not directly related to the SELECT privilege in the Table object), the creation of objects still has Certain associations, for example, the CREAT TABLE privilege in the Database object can create Table objects, which forms a hierarchical relationship between objects, Then, since high-level objects can create low-level objects, the higher-level objects are object creators (Owner) . Object creators (Owner) When an object is created, the creator is the object's owner, who has the highest authority to manage the object (that is, Ownership authority , which is all the authority encapsulated in the object). The owner's operation authority sets all operations on the object. For example, the Table object has Select , Insert , Update , Delete , Truncate , and Ownership privileges; if a role has the Ownership privilege of a certain Table, then the role is equivalent to having Select , Insert , Update , Delete , Truncate privileges. Due to the transitivity between privileges, roles, and users, you can understand the creator of an object (starting now referred to as the object owner) as a role. How to understand that the creator of an object is a role? A user can have multiple roles at the same time. For example, User A has three roles: Role 1, Role 2, and Role 3. Each role has different privileges, as shown in the following figure, to help you quickly understand this behavior: If User A is currently using Role 1 , User A needs to create a new User B , but the current Role 1 does not have privilege to create new users. Role 2 has the authorization to create new users, then User A needs to switch to the Role 2 role and create a new user. Then, the Owner of New User B is Role 2 , and other roles, Role 1 and Role 3 , cannot have the ownership of User B . Owner points to the object An object's Owner is a role, and the object's original Owner is the role that created it. There is only one Owner of an object at any time. A role can create multiple objects so that a role can be the Owner of multiple objects. A role is an object, so a role also has an Owner. When the Owner of an object is deleted, the Owner of the object will be automatically changed to the Owner of the deleted role. The owner can be transferred to another role. Note : ACCOUNTADMIN (account administrator role, automatically generated after the account is created) is not the Owner of the objects used in the account. Still, it has the Ownership privilege of all objects. Cluste The cluster is the highest-level object in MatrixOne privileges management. Tip : The collection of operational privileges on cluster objects is called system privileges. Account In the MatrixOne cluster, multiple accounts with completely isolated data and user authority systems can be created and managed, and these resource-isolated accounts can be managed. This multi-account function not only saves the cost of deploying and operating multiple sets of data business systems but also can take advantage of sharing hardware resources between accounts to save machine costs to the greatest extent. System Account To be compatible with the usage habits of traditional non-multi-account databases, MatrixOne will automatically create a new system default account after the cluster is created, that is, Sys Account . If you only have one set of data business systems that need to be managed by MatrixOne, there is no need to create more accounts, log in and access the Sys Account directly. Role A role is also an object used to manage and grant privileges in MatrixOne. First of all, you need to have a high-privilege account first to do some initial resource allocation; for example, create some roles and users by Sys Account or Account , grant object privileges to the role, and then grant the role to the user, at this time, the user can operate on the object. It needs to be granted to a user. In a account, the user cannot perform any operations if a user is not granted a role. Role is set up to save the operation cost of granting the same authority. The three privileges p1, p2, and p3 must be granted to users u1, u2, and u3. You only need to grant p1, p2, and p3 to role r1 first, then grant role r1 to users u1, u2, and u3 simultaneously. It is easier to operate than granting each privilege to each user separately, and this advantage will become more obvious as the number of users and privileges increases. At the same time, the emergence of roles further abstracts the privilege set and its relationship, which is also very convenient for later privilege maintenance. After the cluster and account (Account) are created, MatrixOne will automatically create some default roles and users (see the Initialization Access section below for details); these roles have the highest management authority and are used to manage the cluster and account at the beginning ( Account), we do not recommend that you grant these roles to users who execute SQL daily. Excessive privileges will introduce more security issues. Therefore, MatrixOne supports the creation of custom roles. You can customize roles according to the user's business needs and assign appropriate privileges to these roles. Highlights In MatrixOne, the behavior details of roles are as follows: A role can be granted multiple privileges. A role can be granted to multiple users. A role can pass its privileges to another role. Use all the privileges of a role to another role; for example, pass all the privileges of role1 to role2, then role2 inherits the privileges of role1, Roles and users only take effect within their respective Account, including the Sys Account. Note The privilege inheritance of roles is dynamic. If the privileges of the inherited role change, the scope of privileges inherited by the inherited role will also change dynamically. The inheritance relationship of roles cannot form a loop. For example, role1 inherits role2, role 2 inherits role3, and role3 inherits role1. The transfer of privileges between roles makes privilege management more convenient, but it also has risks. For this reason, MatrixOne only allows roles with Manage Grants privilege to do this kind of operation. This privilege is granted to the system default role MOADMIN by default or ACCOUNTADMIN , and it is not recommended to grant this privilege to a custom role when creating a new one. Role Switching A user is granted multiple roles to perform different types of data services. Main role : The user can only use one of the roles at a particular moment; we call the currently used role main role . Secondary role : In addition to the main role, the set of other roles owned by the user is called the secondary role . By default, if a user wants to execute SQL with another role's privilege, he needs to switch roles first (Use SQL as set role <role> ). In addition, to be compatible with the privilege behavior of classic databases, MatrixOne also supports the function of using secondary roles : use set secondary role all ; after executing this SQL, the user can have the privileges of all his roles at the same time, execute set secondary role none to turn off this feature. Application scenarios Resource Isolation Scenarios Introduction Company A purchased a MatrixOne cluster and completed the deployment. Since Company A has a large scale, many complex business lines, and a huge amount of data, it wants to develop an application for a certain business line, assuming it is named BusinessApp . Still, it needs to be isolated from the data of other business lines. So how does MatrxiOne isolate these data resources and authority resources? After completing the deployment of the MatrixOne cluster, Tom of the R&D department obtained the account of the cluster administrator, and the company assigned him to complete the task of resource isolation. Tom needs to do this: Tom logs into MatrixOne with the cluster administrator account. Tom needs to create two accounts first, one is BusinessAccount and the other is ElseAccount . The data resources within BusinessAccount are mainly used to develop the application BusinessApp . Data resources within ElseAccount may be used for other business purposes. For the specific operation of resource isolation, please refer to Quick Start: Create accounts, Verify Resource Isolation . Introduction to User Creation and Authorization Scenarios Still using the above scenario example, Tom gives the account account BusinessAccount to the company's data administrator Robert , and asks Robert to assign new user accounts and privileges to other R&D colleagues. R&D colleague Joe is the application developer of this company. A project BusinessApp , Joe has a development task, and Joe needs to use all the data in the database. Then Robert will help Joe open an account and authorize Joe : Robert first creates a user account (i.e., user) for Joe , named Joe_G , and Joe uses Joe_G to log in to MatrixOne. Robert creates another role for Joe , named Appdeveloper , and assigns the Appdeveloper role to Joe 's user account Joe_G . Robert grants the ALL ON DATABASE permission to the role Appdeveloper . Joe can use the account Joe_G to log in to MatrixOne, and has full authority to operate the database for development. For specific user creation and authorization operations, see Quick start: Create a new account, use the new account, creates users, create roles, and grant the privilege .

Since Company A has a large scale, many complex business lines, and a huge amount of data, it wants to develop an application for a certain business line, assuming it is named BusinessApp .

After completing the deployment of the MatrixOne cluster, Tom of the R&D department obtained the account of the cluster administrator, and the company assigned him to complete the task of resource isolation. Tom needs to do this: Tom logs into MatrixOne with the cluster administrator account. Tom needs to create two accounts first, one is BusinessAccount and the other is ElseAccount . The data resources within BusinessAccount are mainly used to develop the application BusinessApp . Data resources within ElseAccount may be used for other business purposes.

If you like, contact the project manager or sales representative of MatrixOne to get the account information and initial password. Using the cluster administrator, you can create a new account, manage the life cycle of the account, and assign the account account password to the corresponding person in charge of your company. For more information on how to manage accounts, see Quick Start: Create accounts, Verify Resource Isolation or Privilege Management Operation Guide . If your enterprise only needs to use MatrixOne cluster account resources, after the deployment is complete, the MatrixOne cluster administrator will help you open an account administrator account. Please contact the MatrixOne project manager or sales representative for the account information and initial password. Using the account administrator account, you can create new users, manage user lifecycles and resources in the account (users, roles, and permissions), and assign user account passwords to the corresponding persons in charge of your company. For more information on how to manage accounts, see Quick Start: Create accounts, Verify Resource Isolation or Privilege Management Operation Guide . Scenario 1: Create a new data administrator and grant the privilege Scenario Introduction In practical application scenarios, it is necessary to set up a data administrator position responsible for managing the allocation of resources in the entire database. For example, other company members need to be assigned a user account, password, and role and be granted minimum Usage rights. Before you start You first need to have an account of account Administrator . Already connected to the MatrixOne cluster. Solution Create a data administrator role and grant him global management permissions within the account; then, you need to do the following: Create a new user, username: dbauser ; password: 123456 . Assign a data administrator role to this user, and the role is named: dba . This role requires the following permissions: Own all permissions of the account object: With this permission, the data administrator can create new users and new roles and assign permissions to other users. Own all permissions of database objects: With this permission, the data administrator can create, edit, and delete databases. Own all permissions of the table object: With this permission, the data administrator can create, edit, and delete data tables. Steps Step 1: Use the account administrator to create the database administrator Log in to the account with the account administrator account: Note : The account administrator account account1 here is an example; you can customize it when creating an account administrator. mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -u account1:admin:admin -p Create a user and named dbauser with a password of 123456 : create user dbauser identified by \"123456\"; Create a data administrator role named dba : create role dba; Grant the privilege to the role the following permissions: Full permissions on the account object Full permissions on database objects Full permissions on the table object grant all on account * to dba with grant option; grant all on database * to dba with grant option; grant all on table *.* to dba with grant option; Grant role dba to user dbauser : grant dba to dbauser; Check the privilege using the following command: show grants for dbauser@localhost; Step 2: Use the data administrator to log and test Log into MatrixOne with the data administrator account dbauser : mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -u account1:dbauser:dba -p Check the privileges of dbauser : show grants for dbauser@localhost; Check the role of dbauser : SET SECONDARY ROLE ALL; use mo_catalog; select mu.user_name,mr.role_name from mo_role mr,mo_user mu,mo_user_grant mug where mu.user_id=mug.user_id and mr.role_id=mug.role_id and mu.user_name='dbauser'; Create a database to verify the privilege is valid: drop database if exists test; create database test; use test; create table t1(a int); insert into t1 values(1),(2),(3); select * from t1; The above code indicates that the verification is successful. Scenario 2: Application System Goes Online Scenario Introduction When the application system goes online, a new database and corresponding database user will be created according to the usage requirements of the application system, and this user will be granted all permissions of the target database. Before you start You first need to have an account of account administrator (or you, as a user, already have full privileges to create new users and authorize new user the database objects). Already connected to the MatrixOne cluster. Solution Requirement 1: The application system requires a new database dedicated to application development. Solution: Create a new database named appdb . Requirement 2: The application system requires a dedicated role. Solution: Create a new database role, named approle , and grant all database privileges to this role. Requirement 3: The application system requires a dedicated person to manage the database. Solution: Create a new database user, named appuser , and authorize the role to this user. Steps Step 1: The account administrator creates and authorizes the database user Log in to the account with the account administrator: Note : The account administrator account account1 here is an example; you can customize it when creating an account administrator. mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -u account1:admin:admin -p To create the database required by the application, name the database appdb : create database appdb; Create a role named approle and grant this role full privilege to database appdb : create role approle; grant all on database appdb to approle; grant all on table appdb.* to approle; Create user appuser with password 123456 and grant the role approle to appuser : create user appuser identified by \"123456\" default role approle; Step 2: Use the data user to log in and test Log into MatrixOne with the data user appuser : mysql -h127.0.0.1 -utest:appuser -P6001 -p123456 Verify the privileges of the data user appuser : set secondary role all; use appdb; create table t1(a int); insert into t1 values(1),(2),(3); select * from t1; drop table t1; The above code indicates that the verification is successful.","title":"Privilege Management Scenario"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Security/role-priviledge-management/app-scenarios/#privilege-management-scenario","text":"","title":"Privilege Management Scenario"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Security/role-priviledge-management/app-scenarios/#scenario-overview","text":"If your company has deployed a MatrixOne cluster after the deployment, a cluster administrator will automatically exist when the cluster is initialized.

this tutorial, you'll learn how to complete a TPC-C Test with MatrixOne. TPC-C Overview TPC-C is an industry-standard benchmark for OLTP databases. TPC-C models a warehouse-centric order processing application, and the database used in the TPC-C benchmark consists of nine tables, such as Warehouse, Customer, Order, Item, and so on (See the below ER diagram). Except for the item table, each record is populated on a per-warehouse basis, and the number of warehouses can be configurable as a scale factor. TPC-C has five transaction types: NewOrder, Payment, OrderStatus, Delivery, and StockLevel. The request rate of each transaction is defined in the specification, and almost 90% of transactions are NewOrder and Payment, which are write-intensive. TPC-C transactions mostly access a single (local) warehouse, but about 10% of transactions interact with another (remote) warehouse. Before you start Make sure you have already Deployed standalone MatrixOne . Clone mo-tpcc repository git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tpcc.git Steps Introduction This section will teach you how to generate the TPCC data, create TPCC tables, load data to MatrixOne, and run TPCC. Now you can execute commands step by step as the following descriptions. 1. Configure the props.mo file After the mo-tpch repository is cloned, open the mo-tpcc directory, and modify the configuration items of the props.mo file. The number of warehouses can be configurable by the warehouse=XX row in this file. db=mo driver=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver conn=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:6001/tpcc?characterSetResults=utf8&continueBatchOnError=false&useServerPrepStmts=true&alwaysSendSetIsolation=false&useLocalSessionState=true&zeroDateTimeBehavior=CONVERT_TO_NULL&failoverReadOnly=false&serverTimezone=Asia/Shanghai&enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2&useSSL=false user=dump password=111 //the number of warehouse warehouses=10 loadWorkers=4 //the num of terminals that will simultaneously run //must be less than warehouses*10 terminals=1 //To run specified transactions per terminal- runMins must equal zero runTxnsPerTerminal=0 //To run for specified minutes- runTxnsPerTerminal must equal zero runMins=1 //Number of total transactions per minute limitTxnsPerMin=0 After the modifications are complete, save the props.mo file. 2. Create TPCC database and tables Open a new terminal window, execute the following command: cd mo-tpcc ./runSQL.sh props.mo tableCreates Npte : If you get an error like java:command not found while running ./runSQL.sh props.mo tableCreates , install or reinstall Java and the JDK on your computer. The above code means to enter the mo-tpch directory and create the TPCC database and table.

Except for the item table, each record is populated on a per-warehouse basis, and the number of warehouses can be configurable as a scale factor. TPC-C has five transaction types: NewOrder, Payment, OrderStatus, Delivery, and StockLevel. The request rate of each transaction is defined in the specification, and almost 90% of transactions are NewOrder and Payment, which are write-intensive.

It consists of a suite of business oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent data modifications. The queries and the data populating the database have been chosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a high degree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions. TPC-H is a widely used benchmark for OLAP databases. By walking through this tutorial, you'll learn how to complete a TPC-H Test with MatrixOne. Before you start Make sure you have already Deployed standalone MatrixOne . 1. Compile TPCH dbgen The tpch dbgen utility generates, by default, a set of flat files suitable for loading into the tpch schema with the size based on the \"Scale Factor\" argument. A scale factor of 1 produces a complete data set of approximately 1 GB, a scale factor of 10 produces a data set of approximately 10 GB and so on. git clone https://github.com/electrum/tpch-dbgen.git cd tpch-dbgen make 2. Generate data Run dbgen for the appropriate database size factor (1GB in the sample). ./dbgen -s 1 Generation may take a while. When completed, you can see the resulting files. total 2150000 -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 24346144 13 may 12:05 customer.tbl -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 759863287 13 may 12:05 lineitem.tbl -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 2224 13 may 12:05 nation.tbl -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 171952161 13 may 12:05 orders.tbl -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 24135125 13 may 12:05 part.tbl -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 118984616 13 may 12:05 partsupp.tbl -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 389 13 may 12:05 region.tbl -rw-r--r-- 1 deister staff 1409184 13 may 12:05 supplier.tbl We have also prepared a 1GB dataset for downloading.

If a case contains SQL with the --bvt:issue tag, use the MO-Tester tool to generate results automatically. SQL with the --bvt:issue tag in the generated result file results as' unknown result because it is related to issue#XXX\" '. 2. If the results have been automatically generated by the MO-Tester tool. When the results are automatically generated by the MO-Tester tool again, the SQL with the tag --bvt:issue will retain the original value in the generated result file, no more updates. Write results manually 1. If the result is writed manually, do not have empty lines. Otherwise, a parsing error occurs. 2. If there are tabs or more than 4 consecutive spaces in the expected execution result of a certain SQL, the corresponding SQL statement in the test case file must be added with Tag -- @separator: , otherwise the parsing will fail. For example, if the SQL in the case file contains 4 consecutive spaces, you need to specify the Tag label -- @separator:table ; if it contains tab characters, specify the Tag label -- @separator:space .

From the 0.5.0 version, MatrixOne introduces an automatic testing framework MO-Tester . This tester is designed to test MatrixOne or other database functionalities with SQL. MO-Tester is a java-based tester suite for MatrixOne. It has built a whole toolchain to run automatic SQL tests. It contains the test cases and results. Once launched, MO-Tester runs all SQL test cases with MatrixOne, and compares all output SQL results with expected results. All successful and failed cases will be logged into reports. MO-Tester content locations: Cases : https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test/distributed/cases Result is generated in the path of /cases , for example, /cases/auto_increment . Report : once finished running, a mo-tester/report will be generated in the local directory. The Cases and Results are 1-1 correspondence, and they are actually git submodules from MatrixOne repository. Adding new cases and results should be in MatrixOne repo: https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test How to use MO-Tester? 1. Prepare the testing environment Make sure you have installed jdk8. Launch MatrixOne or other database instance. Please refer to more information about how to install and launch MatrixOne . Clone mo-tester repository. git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tester.git Clone matrixOne repository. git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git 2. Configure mo-tester In mo.yml file, configure the server address, default database name, username, and password, and so on. MO-tester is based on java, so these parameters are required for the JDBC(JDBC,Java Database Connectivity) driver. Below is a default example for a local standalone version MatrixOne. #jdbc jdbc: driver: \"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\" server: - addr: \"127.0.0.1:6001\" database: default: \"test\" paremeter: characterSetResults: \"utf8\" continueBatchOnError: \"false\" useServerPrepStmts: \"true\" alwaysSendSetIsolation: \"false\" useLocalSessionState: \"true\" zeroDateTimeBehavior: \"CONVERT_TO_NULL\" failoverReadOnly: \"false\" serverTimezone: \"Asia/Shanghai\" socketTimeout: 30000 #users user: name: \"dump\" passwrod: \"111\" 3. Run mo-tester With the simple below command, all the SQL test cases will automatically run and generate reports and error messages to report/report.txt and report/error.txt . > ./run.sh -p {path_name}/matrixone/test/cases If you'd like to adjust the test range, you can just change the path parameter of run.yml . And you can also specify some parameters when executing the command ./run.sh , parameters are as followings: Parameters Description -p set the path of test cases needed to be executed by mo-tester, the default value is configured by the path in run.yaml -m set the method that mo-tester will run with, the default value is configured by the method in run.yaml -t set the type of the format that mo-tester executes the SQL command in, the default value is configured by the type in run.yaml -r set The success rate that test cases should reach, the default value is configured by the rate in run.yaml -i set the including list, and only script files in the path whose name contains one of the lists will be executed, if more than one, separated by , , if not specified, refers to all cases included -e set the excluding list, and script files in the path whose name contains one of the lists will not be executed, if more than one, separated by , , if not specified, refers to none of the cases excluded -g means SQL commands which is marked with [bvt:issue] flag will not be executed,this flag starts with [-- @bvt:issue#{issueNO.}],and ends with [-- @bvt:issue],eg: -- @bvt:issue#3236 select date_add(\"1997-12-31 23:59:59\",INTERVAL \"-10000:1\" HOUR_MINUTE); select date_add(\"1997-12-31 23:59:59\",INTERVAL \"-100 1\" YEAR_MONTH); -- @bvt:issue Those two sql commands are associated with issue#3236, and they will not be executed in bvt test, until the flag is removed when issue#3236 is fixed. -n means the metadata of the resultset will be ignored when comparing the result -c only check whether the case file matches the related result file Examples : ./run.sh -p {path_name}/matrixone/test/cases -m run -t script -r 100 -i select,subquery -e substring -g If you want to automatically generate SQL results for the new SQL cases, you can just change the method parameter of run.yml file to genrs , or you can just change the command -m run to -m genrs , then running the ./run.sh scripts will directly record test results in the same path of the new SQL case file. For more information on example, see Example 4 . Note Every time running run.sh will overwrite the report of the error.txt file, report.txt file, and success.txt file in the mo-tester repository. 4. Check the report Once the test is finished, mo-tester generates error.txt file, report.txt file and success.txt file reports. An example of report.txt file looks like this: [SUMMARY] COST : 98s, TOTAL :12702, SUCCESS : 11851, FAILED :13, IGNORED :838, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 99% [{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/auto_increment/auto_increment_columns.sql] COST : 2.159s, TOTAL :185, SUCCESS :163, FAILED :0, IGNORED :22, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100% [{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/benchmark/tpch/01_DDL/01_create_table.sql] COST : 0.226s, TOTAL :11, SUCCESS :11, FAILED :0, IGNORED :0, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100% [{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/benchmark/tpch/02_LOAD/02_insert_customer.sql] COST : 0.357s, TOTAL :16, SUCCESS :16, FAILED :0, IGNORED :0, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100% Report Keywords Description TOTAL the total number of executed test cases (SQL) SUCCESS The total number of successfully executed test cases(SQL) FAILED the total number of failed executed test case(SQL) IGNORED the total number of ignored executed test cases (SQL), especially with the --bvt:issue tag test cases (SQL) ABNORAML the total number of abnormal executed test cases (SQL), such as the execution of MatrixOne can't determine the actual result is a system exception or .result file parsing error, etc SUCCESS RATE success rate: SUCCESS/(TOTAL - IGNORED) An example of error.txt file looks like this: [ERROR] [SCRIPT FILE]: cases/transaction/atomicity.sql [ROW NUMBER]: 14 [SQL STATEMENT]: select * from test_11 ; [EXPECT RESULT]: c d 1 1 2 2 [ACTUAL RESULT]: c d 1 1 5. Test Examples Example 1 Example Description : Run all test cases in the /cases path of the matrixone repository. Steps : Get the latest matrixone code. cd matrixone git pull https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git To run all the test cases of the matrixone repository, you need switch into the mo-tester repository first, see the following commands: cd mo-tester ./run.sh -p {path_name}/matrixone/test/cases Check the result reports in the error.txt file, report.txt file, and success.txt file in the mo-tester/report/ path.

It contains the test cases and results. Once launched, MO-Tester runs all SQL test cases with MatrixOne, and compares all output SQL results with expected results. All successful and failed cases will be logged into reports. MO-Tester content locations: Cases : https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test/distributed/cases Result is generated in the path of /cases , for example, /cases/auto_increment . Report : once finished running, a mo-tester/report will be generated in the local directory.

Enable Slow Query The slow query log is disabled by default. To use the slow query log function, you must first enable the slow query log function. MatrixOne slow query feature is available with the following basic information: statement : indicates the SQL text that provides the complete SQL statement. request_at : indicates the start time of the SQL statement. duration_second : indicates the actual execution time of the SQL statement. exec_plan : indicates the detailed execution plan of the SQL statement. To enable the slow query, execute the following SQL statements: drop database if exists mo_ts ; create database mo_ts ; use mo_ts ; create view slow_query as select statement , request_at , duration / 1000000000 as duration_second from system . statement_info where statement like 'select%' and duration / 1000000000 > 1 order by request_at desc ; create view slow_query_with_plan as select statement , request_at , duration / 1000000000 as duration_second , exec_plan from system . statement_info where statement like 'select%' and duration / 1000000000 > 1 order by request_at desc ; For all queries longer than 1 second, execute the following SQL statement to view them: > select * from mo_ts . slow_query ; > select * from mo_ts . slow_query_with_plan ; Explanations select * from mo_ts.slow_query; : slow query without plan. select * from mo_ts.slow_query_with_plan; : slow query with plan.. Error Log When slow query is enabled, you can enable error logs, check logs, and locate error information. Enable Error Log To enable the error log, , execute the following SQL statements: create database mo_ts if not exists mo_ts ; use mo_ts ; create view error_message as select timestamp , message from system . log_info where level in ( 'error' , 'panic' , 'faltal' ); create view error_sql as select si . request_at time_stamp , si . statement , si . error as SQL from system . statement_info si where si . user <> 'internal' and si . status = 'Failed' ; Query the error message of database To query the error message of database, execute the following SQL statements: > select * from mo_ts . error_message ; The query result example is as follows: + ----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | timestamp | message | + ----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 2022 -

Before you start A brief introduction about these softwares concerned: Spring Data JPA: JPA is a specification that defines an API for object-relational mappings and for managing persistent objects. Spring Data JPA is an object\u2013relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Intellij IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE for Java developers. It has a lot of plugins that can enhance our efficiency. Maven: Maven is a powerful management tool in Java that can automatically download and import Jar file according to the configuration in the pom.xml file. This feature reduces the conflicts between different versions of Jar files. Spring: Spring is one of the most popular frameworks in Java and more and more enterprise is using the Spring framework to build their project. Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional spring framework. So, it provides all the features of spring and is yet easier to use than spring. Postman: Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. Set up environment 1. Install and Launch MatrixOne Follow the installation instruction and launch MatrixOne . Create a database test by MySQL client. mysql> create database test; 2. Create a new Spring Boot Project Using IntelliJ IDEA Choose Spring Initializer , and name the project as you want. Choose Spring Web , JDBC API , Spring Data JPA , and MySQL Driver as dependencies for this project. Click Create , the project will be created. The dependencies are listed in the pom.xml file. Usually you don't need to modify anything. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\"> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> <groupId>com.example</groupId> <artifactId>jpademo</artifactId> <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version> <name>jpademo</name> <description>jpademo</description> <properties> <java.version>1.8</java.version> <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding> <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding> <spring-boot.version>2.3.7.RELEASE</spring-boot.version> </properties> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>mysql</groupId> <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId> <scope>runtime</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> <exclusions> <exclusion> <groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId> <artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId> </exclusion> </exclusions> </dependency> </dependencies> <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId> <version>${spring-boot.version}</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> <build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.8.1</version> <configuration> <source>1.8</source> <target>1.8</target> <encoding>UTF-8</encoding> </configuration> </plugin> <plugin> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.3.7.RELEASE</version> <configuration> <mainClass>com.example.jpademo.JpademoApplication</mainClass> </configuration> <executions> <execution> <id>repackage</id> <goals> <goal>repackage</goal> </goals> </execution> </executions> </plugin> </plugins> </build> </project> 3. Modify the application.properties file Under resources folder, the MatrixOne connection and Hibernate need to be configured in application.properties file. # Application Name spring.application.name=jpademo # Database driver spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver # Data Source name spring.datasource.name=defaultDataSource # Database connection url, modify to MatrixOne address and port, with parameters spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:6001/test?characterSetResults=UTF-8&continueBatchOnError=false&useServerPrepStmts=true&alwaysSendSetIsolation=false&useLocalSessionState=true&zeroDateTimeBehavior=CONVERT_TO_NULL&failoverReadOnly=false&serverTimezone=Asia/Shanghai&socketTimeout=30000 # Database username and password spring.datasource.username=dump spring.datasource.password=111 # Web application port server.port=8080 # Hibernate configurations spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.id.new_generator_mappings = false spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql = true spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = validate 4. Create table and insert some data in MatrixOne Connect to MatrixOne with MySQL client and execute the following SQL statements. You can save these SQL statements in a book.sql under /resource/database/ . mysql> USE test; mysql> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `book` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `author` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, `category` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, `name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, `pages` int(11) DEFAULT NULL, `price` int(11) DEFAULT NULL, `publication` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ); mysql> INSERT INTO `book` (`id`, `author`, `category`, `name`, `pages`, `price`, `publication`) VALUES (1, 'Antoine de Saint-Exupery', 'Fantancy', 'The Little Prince', 100, 50, 'Amazon'), (2, 'J.

Spring Data JPA is an object\u2013relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Intellij IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE for Java developers. It has a lot of plugins that can enhance our efficiency. Maven: Maven is a powerful management tool in Java that can automatically download and import Jar file according to the configuration in the pom.xml file. This feature reduces the conflicts between different versions of Jar files. Spring: Spring is one of the most popular frameworks in Java and more and more enterprise is using the Spring framework to build their project. Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional spring framework. So, it provides all the features of spring and is yet easier to use than spring. Postman: Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.","title":"Before you start"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/springboot-hibernate-crud-demo/#set-up-environment","text":"","title":"Set up environment"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/springboot-hibernate-crud-demo/#1-install-and-launch-matrixone","text":"Follow the installation instruction and launch MatrixOne .

We only need to focus on the SQL itself in our project. Intellij IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE for Java developers. It has a lot of plugins that can enhance our efficiency. Maven: Maven is a powerful management tool in Java that can automatically download and import Jar file according to the configuration in the pom.xml file. This feature reduces the conflicts between different versions of Jar files. Spring: Spring is one of the most popular frameworks in Java and more and more enterprise is using the Spring framework to build their project. Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional spring framework. So, it provides all the features of spring and is yet easier to use than spring. Set up environment 1. Install and Launch MatrixOne Follow the installation instruction and launch MatrixOne . Create a database test by MySQL client. mysql> create database test; 2. Create a new Spring Boot Project Using IntelliJ IDEA Choose Spring Initializer , and name the project as you want. Choose Spring Web , MyBatis Framework , JDBC API and MySQL Driver as dependencies for this project. Click Create , the project will be created. The dependencies are listed in the pom.xml file.

SQLAlchemy is one of the most popular ORM tools in python language. Before you start A brief introduction about these softwares concerned: SQLAlchemy: SQLAlchemy is a python library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases. Most of the times, this library is used as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tool that translates Python classes to tables on relational databases and automatically converts function calls to SQL statements. Faker: Faker is a Python library that generates fake data. Fake data is often used for testing or filling databases with some dummy data. Setup your environment Before you start, make sure you have downloaded and installed the following software. Make sure you have already installed and launched MatrixOne . Connect to MatrixOne and create a database by MySQL client. mysql> create database test; Make sure you have already installed Python 3.8(or plus) version . #To check with Python installation and its version python3 -V Make sure you have already installed MySQL. Download and install sqlalchemy, pymysql, cryptography and faker tool. pip3 install sqlalchemy pip3 install pymysql pip3 install cryptography pip3 install faker #If you are in China mainland and have a low downloading speed, you can speed up the download by following commands. pip3 install sqlalchemy -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple pip3 install pymysql -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple pip3 install cryptography -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple pip3 install faker -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple As we have explained how to connect to MatrixOne by SQLAlchemy in the other tutorial , we will focus on the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementations in this tutorial. Create As an Object Relational Mapper(ORM) tool, SQLAlchemy allows developers to create python class to map the table in relational database. In the example below, we will create a Customer class which is a representation of Customer table in MatrixOne, the code which defines Customer is equal to a SQL statement as: CREATE TABLE `User` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `cname` VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT NULL, `caddress` VARCHAR(512) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) Let's now create this example in a text file named sqlalchemy_create.py , and put the following code: from faker import Factory from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker faker = Factory.create() engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://dump:111@127.0.0.1:6001/test') Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) session = Session() Base = declarative_base() class Customer(Base): __tablename__ = \"Customer\" id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True,autoincrement=True) cname = Column(String(64)) caddress = Column(String(512)) def __init__(self,name,address): self.cname = name self.caddress = address def __str__(self): return \"cname:\"+self.cname +\" caddress:\"+self.caddress def __repr__(self): return \"cname:\"+self.cname +\" caddress:\"+self.caddress # Generate 10 Customer records Customers = [Customer(name= faker.name(),address = faker.address()) for i in range(10)] # Create the table Base.metadata.create_all(engine) # Insert all customer records to Customer table session.add_all(Customers) session.commit() Execute this file in a terminal with such command: > python3 sqlalchemy_create.py Then we verify the table creation in MySQL client: mysql> show tables; +----------------+ | tables_in_test | +----------------+ | Customer | +----------------+ 1 row in set (0.04 sec) mysql> select * from `Customer`; +------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | id | cname | caddress | +------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | 1 | Wendy Luna | 002 Brian Plaza Andrewhaven, SC 88456 | | 2 | Meagan Rodriguez | USCGC Olson FPO AP 21249 | | 3 | Angela Ramos | 029 Todd Curve Apt. 352 Mooreville, FM 15950 | | 4 | Lisa Bruce | 68103 Mackenzie Mountain North Andrew, UT 29853 | | 5 | Julie Moore | Unit 1117 Box 1029 DPO AP 87468 | | 6 | David Massey | 207 Wayne Groves Apt. 733 Vanessashire, NE 34549 | | 7 | David Mccann | 97274 Sanders Tunnel Apt. 480 Anthonyberg, DC 06558 | | 8 | Morgan Price | 57463 Lisa Drive Thompsonshire, NM 88077 | | 9 | Samuel Griffin | 186 Patel Crossing North Stefaniechester, WV 08221 | | 10 | Tristan Pierce | 593 Blankenship Rapids New Jameshaven, SD 89585 | +------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ 10 rows in set (0.03 sec) Read In the following example, we read data from the Customer table by two ways.
