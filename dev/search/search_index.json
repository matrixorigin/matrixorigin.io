They are a fundamental part of the way a compiler works. C Cluster A distributed MatrixOne deployment, which acts as a single logical application. E Explicit Transactions Explicit Transaction has the beginning, ending and rollback of transactions with the command Begin Transaction, Commit Transaction and Rollback Transaction. I Implicit Transactions Implicit Transaction is the auto commit. There is no beginning or ending of the transaction. O Optimistic transaction Optimistic transaction, the optimistic transaction means that when the transaction starts, no conflict detection or lock will be performed, the current relevant data will be cached in the corresponding memory area, and the data will be added, deleted, or modified. P Pessimistic transaction Pessimistic transaction, the default transaction mode of MatrixOne, that is, when the transaction starts, it will assume that the transaction-related tables are in a state where write conflicts will occur and lock the corresponding data table or a data row in advance to complete the locking action Finally, the insertion, modification, or deletion of data is cached in memory. After committing or rolling back, the data is placed on the disk, and the lock is released. S Snapshot Isolation (SI) Snapshot Isolation is a multi-version concurrency control approach that is widely used in practice. MatrixOne supports distributed transaction of snapshot isolation level."},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#concepts","title":"Concepts","text":"<p>MatrixOne relies heavily on the following concepts. Being familiar with them will help you understand what our architecture achieves.</p> Term Definition A Auto-Rebalance A modern distributed database should do more than just split data amongst a number of servers. The automatic process of storage and workload distribution among servers is called an Auto-Rebalance. C Consistency MatrixOne supports a strong consistency. It is guaranted that after any successful data write, the reading afterwards will get the latest value, no matter from which store. E Execution Plan An execution plan in a database is a simple graphical representation of the operations that the query optimizer generates to calculate the most efficient way to return a set of results. F Fault-Tolerance Fault-Tolerance simply means a system's ability to continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of one or more of its components. M Monolithic Engine A monolithic database engine is designed to support hybrid workloads: transactional, analytical, streaming, time-series, machine learning, and so on. Materialized View A materialized view is a pre-computed data set derived from a query specification (the SELECT in the view definition) and stored for later use. Materialized view is usually used for increasing performance and efficiency. Metadata Metadata is the data that describes the structure and creation method of data in a database. P Paxos Paxos is an algorithm that is used to achieve consensus among a distributed set of computers that communicate via an asynchronous network. R Raft Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. Raft Group and Leader Raft defines a strong, single leader and number of followers in a group of peers. The group represents a replicated state machine. Only the leader may service client requests. The leader replicates actions to the followers. S SIMD instruction SIMD is short for Single Instruction/Multiple Data, while the term SIMD operations refers to a computing method that enables processing of multiple data with a single instruction. T Transaction A set of operations performed on your database that satisfy the requirements of ACID semantics. TAE Transactional Analytic Engine. The storage engine is the main public interface of the storage layer, which can support both row and column storage and transaction processing capabilities. V Vectorized Execution Vectorized data processing helps with developing faster analytical query engines by making efficient utilization of CPU cache. Arrow's columnar format allows to use lightweight schemes like dictionary encoding, bit packing, and run length encoding, which favor query performance over compression ratio."},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/make-your-first-contribution/","title":"Make Your First Contribution","text":"<p>Thank you for your interest in contributing to MatrixOne.

Regardless of the specifics, we suggest you stay friendly first:  </p> <ul> <li>Be respectful Be respectful to every pull request author and other reviewers. Code review is a part of community activities so you should follow the community requirements.</li> <li>Be careful with tone Try to frame your comments as suggestions or questions instead of commands. If the tone is softer, your reviews will be easier to accept.</li> <li>Be generous with your compliments We recommend you offer encouragement and appreciation to the authors for their good practices in the code segments. In many cases, telling the authors what they did is right is even more valuable than telling them what they did is wrong.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, here are some suggestions in terms of content:  </p> <ul> <li>Provide more We encourage you to provide additional details and context of your review process as much as you can. Undoubtedly, the more detailed your review, the more useful it will be to others. If you test the pull request, please report the result and your test environment details. If you request some changes, try to suggest how.</li> <li>Keep objective Avoid individual biased opinions and subjective emotions. Of course, everyone will comment with more or less subjective opinions. However, as a good reviewer, you should consider the technique and data facts rather than your own personal preferences.</li> <li>Case by case It's difficult to decide whether it's more reasonable to accept or reject when you are faced with a complex problem. Regrettably, we can't provide a certain answer because it always depends on the specific situation, which asks you to balance the pros and cons.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/How-to-Contribute/review-a-pull-request/#classifying-pull-requests","title":"Classifying pull requests","text":"<p>Some pull request authors may not be familiar with MatrixOne, the MatriOne development workflow, or the MatrixOne community.

No matter how small it is, the change does exactly one thing and gets it right. Don't mix other changes into it.</li> <li>Tests   A pull request should be test covered, whether the tests are unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. Tests should be sufficient, correct, and don't slow down the CI pipeline largely.</li> <li>Functionality   The pull request should implement what the author intends to do, fit well in the existing code base, and resolve a real problem for users. Thus you should check whether or not the pull request achieves the intention and you could follow the discussions in the corresponding GitHub issue.  </li> <li>Style   Code in the pull request should follow a common programming style. However, sometimes the existing code is inconsistent with the style guide. You should maintain consistency with the existing code or file a new issue to fix the existing code style first.</li> <li>Documentation   If a pull request changes how users build, test, interact with, or release code, you must check whether it also updates the related documentation such as <code>README.md</code> and any generated reference docs. Similarly, if a pull request deletes or deprecates code, you must check whether or not the corresponding documentation should also be deleted.</li> <li>Performance   If you find the pull request may affect performance, you could ask the author to provide a benchmark result.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/How-to-Contribute/types-of-contributions/","title":"Types of Contributions","text":"<p>Contributions to MatrixOne are not limited to writing code.

The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.\n# There are a few important trade-offs here:\n#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.\n#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.\n#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.\n# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or\n# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.\n\n# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk\n#log.flush.interval.messages=10000\n\n# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush\n#log.flush.interval.ms=1000\n\n############################# Log Retention Policy #############################\n\n# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments.

heterogeneous data sources that provides stable and efficient data synchronization for efficient data synchronization between heterogeneous data sources.</p> <p>DataX divides synchronization of different data sources into two main components: Reader and Writer. The DataX framework theoretically supports data synchronization efforts for any data source type.</p> <p>MatrixOne is highly compatible with MySQL 8.0, but since DataX's included MySQL Writer plug-in adapts to the JDBC driver of MySQL 5.1, the community has separately revamped the MySQL 8.0-driven MatrixOneWriter plug-in to improve compatibility. The MatrixOneWriter plugin implements the ability to write data to the MatrixOne database target table. In the underlying implementation, the MatrixOneWriter connects to a remote MatrixOne database via JDBC and executes the corresponding <code>insert into ...</code> SQL statement to write data to MatrixOne, while supporting bulk commits.</p> <p>MatrixOneWriter leverages the DataX framework to get the generated protocol data from Reader and generates the appropriate <code>insert into...</code> statement based on the <code>writeMode</code> you configured. When a primary key or unique index conflict is encountered, conflicting rows are excluded and writes continue. For performance optimization reasons, we took the <code>PreparedStatement + Batch</code> approach and set the <code>rewriteBatchedStatements=true</code> option to buffer the data into the thread context's buffer. A write request is triggered only when the amount of data in the buffer reaches a predetermined threshold.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>You need to have at least <code>insert into ...</code> permissions to execute the entire task. Whether you need additional permissions depends on your <code>preSql</code> and <code>postSql</code> in the task configuration.</p> <p>MatrixOneWriter is primarily intended for ETL development engineers who use MatrixOneWriter to import data from a data warehouse into MatrixOne. At the same time, MatrixOneWriter can also serve users such as DBAs as a data migration tool.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Ecological-Tools/Etl/DataX/datax-postgresql-matrixone/","title":"Write data to MatrixOne using DataX","text":"<p>This article describes how to write

In this mode, publishers and subscribers are loosely coupled and do not require direct communication between them, thus improving the scalability and flexibility of the application.</p> <p>In databases, publish and subscribe functions are usually used in real-time data updates, cache synchronization, business event notifications and other scenarios. For example, when data in a certain table in the database changes, subscribers can be notified in real time through the publish and subscribe function, thereby achieving real-time data synchronization and processing. In addition, the publish and subscribe function can also be used to implement notification of business events, such as an order being canceled, a certain inventory quantity being insufficient, etc.</p> <p>Usually, the publish and subscribe function of the database consists of two parts: Publisherand Subscriber. Publisheris responsible for publishing messages, while Subscriberssubscribe to corresponding messages to achieve data synchronization.

At this time, the transaction becomes very important; it can make the system data out of this inconsistent state.</p> <p>How to understand transaction? For example, in the banking system, if there is no transaction to control and manage the data, A likely withdraws a sum of money from the corporate account, and B and C also withdraw money from the same corporate account. Each transfer involves at least two changes in account information (for example, A's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; B's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; C's money comes, and the company's account goes out), If there are no transactions, then the exact value of the booking amount cannot be determined. After introducing the business requirement of the transaction, the essential characteristics of the transaction (ACID) ensure that the fund operation of the bank book is atomic (indivisible) and the amount seen by others is isolated.

The database system usually uses a locking mechanism or a multi-version concurrency control mechanism to obtain a higher isolation level. Application software also requires additional logic to make it work properly.</p> <p>Many database management systems (DBMS) define different \"transaction isolation levels\" to control the degree of locking. In many database systems, most transactions avoid high-level isolation levels (such as serializability) to reduce locking overhead. Programmers must carefully analyze the database access part of the code to ensure that lowering the isolation level does not cause hard-to-find code bugs. On the contrary, a higher isolation level will increase the chance of deadlock, which must be avoided during programming.</p> <p>The DBMS is allowed to use a higher isolation level than the one requested because there are no operations in a higher isolation level that are prohibited by a lower isolation level.</p> <p>ANSI/ISO SQL defines four standard isolation levels:</p> Isolation Level Dirty Write Dirty Read Fuzzy Read Phantom READ UNCOMMITTED Not Possible Possible Possible Possible READ COMMITTED Not Possible Not Possible Possible Possible REPEATABLE READ Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Possible SERIALIZABLE Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible <ul> <li> <p>READ UNCOMMITTED: READ UNCOMMITTED is the lowest isolation level. \"Dirty reads\" are allowed, and transactions can see the \"not committed\" modifications of other transactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>READ COMMITTED: At the READ COMMITTED level, the DBMS based on lock mechanism concurrency control needs to keep the write lock on the selected object until the end of the transaction, but the read lock is released immediately after the SELECT operation is completed. Like the previous isolation level, \"scope locks\" are not required.</p> </li> <li> <p>REPEATABLE READS: At the REPEATABLE READS isolation level, the DBMS based on the lock mechanism concurrency control needs to keep the read locks (read locks) and write locks (write locks) of the selected objects until the transaction end but does not require a \"range lock\", so a \"phantom read\" may occur. MatrixOne has implemented Snapshot Isolation and it is also known as REPEATABLE READS to maintain consistency with the isolation level in MySQL.</p> </li> <li> <p>SERIALIZABLE: SERIALIZABLE is the highest isolation level. On lock-based concurrency control DBMSs, serializability requires that read and write locks on selected objects be released at the end of the transaction. Using a \"WHERE\" clause in a SELECT query to describe a range should acquire a \"range-locks\".</p> </li> </ul> <p>Higher levels provide stronger isolation by requiring more restrictions than lower isolation levels.

Here are some scenarios for using <code>BITMAP</code>:</p> <ol> <li> <p>User Behavior Analysis: Suppose an e-commerce platform wants to analyze the behavior patterns of different users. They have an event table that records every click event a user has, including user ID, timestamp, event type, etc. By using <code>BITMAP</code>, it is possible to quickly categorize and count the behavior of users, e.g. to find out the number of users who have all made a \"purchase\" behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multidimensional analysis: In a data warehouse, it is often necessary to analyze multiple dimensions, such as sales in different regions over a given time period. With <code>BITMAP</code>, the two dimensions of date and region can be quickly filtered to improve query efficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Counting different values: When working with columns with a large number of unique values, such as product category or user status, <code>BITMAP</code> allows you to efficiently calculate the number of different values in those columns. For example, a social media platform may need to count different numbers of its users active (online, offline).</p> </li> <li> <p>Hierarchical aggregation acceleration: <code>BITMAP</code> accelerates the calculation process when hierarchical aggregation queries are required, such as quarterly and annual aggregation of sales data. By using <code>BITMAP</code>, data can be grouped and aggregated quickly to get the statistics you need.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimize complex queries: For complex queries with multiple criteria, <code>BITMAP</code> can quickly filter out eligible data. For example, a financial firm may need to identify users who satisfy both \"high net worth clients\" and \"invest in specific funds\".</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/distinct-data/bitmap/#prepare-before-you-start","title":"Prepare before you start","text":"<p>Completed standalone deployment of MatrixOne.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/distinct-data/bitmap/#cases","title":"Cases","text":"<p>According to the above scenario one design case,the behavior patterns of different users of e-commerce platform are analyzed.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/distinct-data/bitmap/#steps","title":"Steps","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/distinct-data/bitmap/#1-create-user-tables-and-import-data","title":"1.

Basically, JSONL is a file format that allows one JSON object per line with lines delimited by a newline character <code>\\n</code>.  Each line of the file is independent, so commas are not required at the beginning or ending of lines.  Nor does the entire contents of the file need to be enclosed in square or curly braces.</p> <p>JSONLines is appealing format for data streaming.

Just read a line, parse as JSON, read a line, parse as JSON\u2026 and so on.</p> <p>The JSON Lines format has three requirements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>UTF-8 Encoding: JSON allows encoding Unicode strings with only ASCII escape sequences, however those escapes will be hard to read when viewed in a text editor.

Is it possible to grant permissions directly to the user?</p> <p>MatrixOne's rights management is designed and implemented using a combination of role-based access control (RBAC) and autonomous access control (DAC) security models. MatrixOne does not support granting rights directly to users and requires authorization through roles.</p> <p>How does a highly available architecture work?</p> <p>There is currently no highly available architecture for the standalone version of MatrixOne, and the highly available architecture for the master-slave version is still being designed. Distributed versions are inherently highly available, and both k8s and s3 are inherently highly available architectures. MatrixOne's nodes cn and tn are stateless, hang can be pulled up at any time, the log service is stateful, its 3 nodes are a distributed architecture that provides a raft group, hang 1 is okay, keep running, hang 2 systems will be unavailable.</p> <p>Does the current tn node of the k8s cluster node support expansion?</p> <p>Scaling is not yet supported by the current tn node of MatrixOne.</p> <p>What are the various components used for? Minimize how many instances do you need to deploy? Can you support non-stop non-sensual expansion later?</p> <p>The MatrixOne core has 4 components, proxy,cn,tn,log service. cn is the stateless compute node, tn is the transaction node, and log service is the log of the transaction, equivalent to WAL. proxy is used for load balancing and resource group management. It can be done in 3 physical/virtual machines if they are all deployed in a hybrid. Senseless expansion is possible, mo is memory separated, and the expansion of storage is the expansion of s3. The calculated expansion is cn, itself based on k8s, cn stateless, and a container that can be expanded quickly.</p> <p>How is resource isolation achieved between multiple tenants?</p> <p>The resource isolation core of MatrixOne is that the ACCOUNT can correspond to the resource group of the CN Set, or the tenant isolation can be considered the container isolation of the CN. In addition to different resource groups that can be assigned by multi-tenants, CN resource groups can be further assigned within a single tenant based on business type for more granular control. For a complete description of resource isolation, see Load and Tenant Isolation</p> <p>Can the table engine in MySQL be migrated directly? Is it compatible with engines like InnoDB?</p> <p>MatrixOne does not support MySQL's InnoDB, MyISAM and other engines, but can use MySQL's statements directly. MatrixOne ignores these engines, and there is only one storage engine in MatrixOne, TAE, which has been developed completely independently and can be applied to all kinds of scenarios in a friendly manner without using ENGINE=XXX to replace the engine.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/FAQs/product-faqs/#functionally-related","title":"Functionally related","text":"<p>What applications does MatrxOne support?</p> <p>MatrixOne provides users with the ultimate HTAP service.

For example, for a large file of 2 Gs, two threads are used to load it, and the second thread is split-positioned to the 1G position and then read back and loaded. This allows two threads to read large files simultaneously, each reading 1G of data.

This process is usually performed at the file system level and can be implemented through operating system commands. The generated backup is a complete backup of the database, including all data and objects. Backup files can be stored on a variety of media and can be compressed and encrypted to save space and increase security. During recovery, these files can be copied directly to the required location to quickly recover the entire database. In addition, physical backup supports cross-platform migration and is suitable for disaster recovery and database migration scenarios, but may require more storage space and time.</p> <p>Full backup refers to the backup process of backing up all data in the database. It creates a complete copy of the database, which usually requires more storage space and longer time to complete. Because it contains all data, full backup is relatively simple to restore and can be restored directly to the state at the time of backup.</p> <p>Incremental backup means backing up data that has changed since the last backup. It only copies data blocks or data files that have been modified between backups, so the backup set is usually smaller and the backup speed is faster. Incremental backups can save storage space and backup time, but may be more complex during data recovery because a series of incremental backups need to be applied in sequence to restore to the latest state.</p> <p>MatrixOne supports incremental and full physical backup recovery using <code>mo_br</code>:</p> <p>Note</p> <p>mo_br enterprise-level service backup and recovery tool, you need to contact your MatrixOne account manager to obtain the tool download path.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Maintain/backup-restore/mobr-backup-restore/mobr-physical-backup-restore/#example","title":"Example","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Maintain/backup-restore/mobr-backup-restore/mobr-physical-backup-restore/#example-1-full-backup-and-restore","title":"Example 1 Full backup and restore","text":"<ul> <li>Connect mo to create databases db1, db2.</li> </ul> <pre><code>create database db1;\ncreate database db2;\n\nmysql&gt;

Physical backup can achieve fast and complete database recovery by copying the physical files of the database, such as data files and log files, and is especially suitable for overall database migration or disaster recovery. On the other hand, snapshot backup provides a fast and storage-efficient backup method by recording the status of data at a specific point in time. It is suitable for scenarios that require point-in-time recovery or read-only query operations, such as generating reports or performing data processing. analyze. The recovery of physical backups may take a long time, while snapshot backups can provide fast data access. The combination of the two can provide comprehensive protection for the database and ensure data security and business continuity.</p> <p>MatrixOne supports regular physical backups and snapshot backups via the <code>mo_br</code> utility.

By monitoring database changes, it enables real-time data synchronization and incremental processing, ensuring consistency across different systems. CDC is suitable for scenarios such as real-time data synchronization, data migration, disaster recovery, and audit tracking. It reads transaction logs to reduce the pressure of full data replication and improves system performance and efficiency. Its advantages include low latency, high real-time capability, flexible support for multiple databases and systems, and adaptability to evolving large-scale data environments.</p> <p>Before performing CDC synchronization, it is necessary to first establish PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) capabilities covering the synchronization scope, with a recommended coverage of at least 2 hours of changes. This ensures that if the synchronization task is interrupted or encounters an exception, the system can backtrack and re-read the changed data, avoiding data loss or inconsistency.</p> <p>MatrixOne supports data synchronization at the tenant/database/table level through the <code>mo_cdc</code> utility.

Many enterprises equip a separate analytical database system to meet statistical report needs at essential points like month-end, quarter-end, etc. Using MatrixOne; these needs can be met with a single database system, providing strong scalability that seamlessly scales with business growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dashboard/BI Report Scenarios Requiring Real-Time Analytical Capabilities</p> <p>For typical OLAP-type applications in enterprises, such as dashboards, BI reports, etc., analyzing massive amounts of data often leads to a performance bottleneck when the data volume is significantly large, resulting in poor timeliness.

The demand for digitization also requires enterprises to store and use these data increasingly. Traditional database solutions cannot meet the requirements of such massive and large-scale real-time data writing and processing applications.

To fully understand the enterprise's overall status, many enterprises build a data middle-end that connects data sources from various systems. Traditional solutions to carry the data middle-end are based on the Hadoop system, which is complex, posing high development and operation thresholds for many enterprises. MatrixOne's one-stop HTAP architecture makes using a data middle-end as convenient as using MySQL, significantly reducing costs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Business Scenarios with Dramatic and Frequent Internet Business Fluctuations</p> <p>Internet applications such as games, e-commerce, entertainment, social networking, news, etc., have a massive user base, and the business fluctuates dramatically and frequently.

MatrixOne's fully cloud-native architecture has superior scalability, enabling automatic and rapid scaling with business changes, significantly reducing user operation and maintenance difficulties.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enterprise SaaS Service Business Scenarios</p> <p>Enterprise SaaS applications have seen explosive growth in recent years. In developing SaaS applications, they all need to consider their multi-tenant model. Traditional schemes offer two modes of multi-tenant shared database instances and single-tenant exclusive database instances, but they face the dilemma of management cost and isolation. MatrixOne comes with multi-tenant capabilities; tenants are naturally load-isolated and can be independently scaled.

This design allows MatrixOne to maintain excellent performance while keeping operating costs low.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-cold-hot-data-separation/#technical-architecture","title":"Technical Architecture","text":"<p>In the overall architecture of MatrixOne, two parts are responsible for persistent data storage. One is the object storage shared by the entire MatrixOne distributed cluster, which is the primary storage device of the cluster. The other is the local storage on each compute node (CN), mainly used for data caching. The primary storage contains all data of the entire cluster, while the cache only saves data extracted from the primary storage during recent queries. In addition, the memory of CN nodes is also used as part of the data cache.</p> <p></p> <p>When a user initiates a query, the system first checks whether the cache of the CN to which the user is connected already contains the required data. If it exists, the system directly returns the result to the user, prioritizing memory over disk. Suppose the required data is not found in the cache of the currently connected CN. In that case, the system queries the global metadata information to see if the required data exists in the cache of other available CNs for this user, checking memory first and then disk. If it exists, the system redirects the request to the CN containing this data, processes it, and returns the result to the user. If the data searched for is not in the cache of any available CN, the system initiates a read request to the object storage and returns the result to the user.</p> <p></p> <p>When a user queries data from object storage, the queried data block will be filled into the corresponding position according to the cache query order. For example, if a user queries 100M of data from object storage, this 100M of data will first be written into the memory of the CN node to which the user is connected and then written into the disk cache of this CN node. Each time a new query is generated, the data in the cache will be updated according to this rule. Whether in memory or disk, data replacement in the CN cache follows the LRU (Least Recently Used) principle. With this mechanism, the most recent data is always in the easiest-to-get position, while relatively unpopular data will gradually be removed from the cache.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-cold-hot-data-separation/#product-features","title":"Product Features","text":"<p>The features of data caching and hot-cold data separation bring unique advantages to the product.

A typical K8S Operator consists of an API and a controller:</p> <ul> <li>API</li> </ul> <p>Typically declared through K8S' CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) object, after committing a K8S CRD to K8S's api-server, the api-server registers a corresponding Restful API with itself. All K8SClients can get, LIST, POST, DELETE, etc. on this newly declared API in a similar way to manipulating native resources. By convention, within each API object, the <code>.spec</code> structure is managed by the user to declare the desired state of the object, and the <code>.status</code> structure is managed by the controller below to expose the actual state of the object.</p> <ul> <li>Controller</li> </ul> <p>A controller is an ongoing piece of code that monitors (watches) a range of K8S objects, including the API objects we just defined. Then, automation is performed based on the expected state of these objects and the actual state collected from the reality (note: the actual state here is collected from the reality and rewritten into <code>.status</code>, not directly from <code>.status</code>) to drive the actual state to the desired state. The process continues in a loop, graphically known as a control loop, and in some places with a more classical word, reconciliation loop, cleverly keeping the flavors aligned with K8S's word for \"orchestration.\"</p> <p>The following diagram provides a general description of the process using the simplified MatrixOneCluster API as an example:</p> <p>MatrixOne-Operator provides not only load-based APIs such as MatrixOneCluster for managing MO clusters, but also task-based APIs such as backup recovery and resource-based APIs such as object buckets. Each API and their controller are designed with unique considerations in mind, but invariably, all APIs and controllers are built in the above pattern. Next, we'll continue exploring the tradeoffs in each API design.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-matrixone-operator/#cluster-api-design","title":"Cluster API Design","text":"<p>A distributed MO cluster consists of multiple components such as log services, transaction nodes, compute nodes, and proxies, where compute nodes also have explicit heterogeneous requirements to achieve model optimization for load and capabilities across clouds, cloud edges, and more. Centralizing the management of an entire cluster into one API object and declaring another controller to manage, while easy to use, is a code maintenance nightmare. Therefore, MatrixOne-Operator made the principle of loosely coupled fine-grained APIs clear at the beginning of its design, designing clear APIs with responsibilities such as LogSet, CNSet, ProxySet, BucketClaim, and controllers that are independent of each other. To maintain ease of use, the MatrixOneCluster API was also introduced. Responsible for MatrixOneCluster controllers not duplicating the work of other controllers\u2014when a cluster requires a LogSet to provide logging services, the MatrixOneCluster controller simply creates a LogSet object and delegates the rest to the LogSet controller.</p> <p>With this design, while there are many APIs, users always only need to care about the MatrixOneCluster API, and the developers of MatrixOne-Operator are adding features or solving problems, often with problem domains no larger than a fine-grained API and controller.</p> <p>Of course, there are certain dependencies between multiple API objects, such as transaction nodes and compute nodes that rely on HAKeeper running in the log service to get cluster information for service discovery. This requires that the logging service be started and HAKeeper bootstrap completed when the cluster is deployed before the transaction and compute nodes can continue to start. While this type of logic can be implemented by a MatrixOneCluster controller, it also means that the business knowledge of other controllers is compromised and the implementation of the individual controls still creates coupling. Therefore, in mo-operator, we implement the business logic that creates dependencies between all components on the relying party, which exposes itself to the outside world only through the convention <code>.status</code> field. For example, when a controller is tuning a CNset, it actively waits for the LogSet pointed to by the CNSet to be ready before following up. Neither the LogSet controller nor the upper MatrixOneCluster controller need to be aware of this.</p> <p>The loosely coupled fine-grained API adapts well to CN's heterogeneous orchestration scenarios. In MatrixOne-Operator, in addition to the convenient usage of declaring multiple CN groups in MatrixOneCluster for heterogeneous orchestration, it is also possible to directly create a CNSet to join an existing cluster, which means that the new CNSet can be deployed in another set of K8S clusters with network-level support for MO orchestration across clouds or cloud-side scenarios.</p> <p>During iterations of individual controllers, MatrixOne-Operator also tends to add new features by adding new API objects. For example, when implementing object storage management, MatrixOne-Operator needs to ensure that there is no intersection between object storage paths used by different clusters and that they are cleaned up automatically after the cluster is destroyed. MatrixOne-Operator's solution is to add a BucketClaim API that references the control logic of K8S PersistentVolumeClaim to complete lifecycle management of an object storage path in a standalone controller, avoiding complex race condition handling and code coupling issues.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-matrixone-operator/#controller-implementation","title":"Controller implementation","text":"<p>K8S provides the controller-runtime package to help developers implement their own controllers, but for versatility the interface design is relatively low-level:</p> <pre><code>Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req Request)(Result, error) \n</code></pre> <p>The controller needs to implement the Reconcile interface, which is then registered through the controller-runtime interface, declare the objects to listen on, and some filtering rules for listening. The controller-runtime calls the controller's Reconcile method each time the object changes or retries Reconcile, and passes the identifier of the target object in the req parameter. There will be a lot of template code within this interface, usually represented by pseudocode:</p> <pre><code>func tuning(Namespace+Name of object A) {\n  Get the Spec of object A\n  if object A is being deleted {\n    Execute the cleanup logic\n    update the cleanup progress to A.status\n    remove finalizer on object A\n  } else {\n    Add finalizer to A\n    Execute the tuning logic\n    Update tuning progress to A.status\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Similar logic recurs in various community controller implementations, and developers need to care about a lot more than business: handling finalizers correctly to ensure that resources are not leaked, updating progress and errors to status in a timely manner to increase visibility, and more detailed loggers with context and kubeClient with cache issues.</p> <p>Since there is no need to consider versatility, there is a more specialized abstraction within MatrixOne-Operator, designing the Actor interface:</p> <pre><code>type Actor[T client.Object] interface {  \n    Observe(*Context[T]) (Action[T], error)  \n    Finalize(*Context[T]) (done bool, err error)  \n}\n\ntype Action[T client.Object] func(*Context[T]) error\n</code></pre> <p>Behind that, the generic controller framework logic takes care of all the logic and details similar to the template code above, preparing within Context[T] the objects that currently need to be reconciled and the Logger, EventRecorder, KubeClient objects that have already taken care of the context. Finally:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When tuning an undeleted object, call Actor.Observe to have real business logic perform the tuning;</p> </li> <li> <p>When tuning an object in progress, Actor.Finalize is called to perform resource cleanup behavior within the business logic, retrying until Finalize returns completion before removing the object's finalizer.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The state machine for an object is as follows:</p> <p>Under this process, a controller is straightforward about the implementation of both the create and destroy parts of API object lifecycle management. Nothing more than calling K8S's API to request storage, deploy workloads, configure service discovery, or conversely destroying all external resources created while the API is in the delete phase, in conjunction with MO's operational knowledge. The object's updated tuning operation is also regular diff logic to MatrixOneCluster's. The cnSets field, for example, can be represented by the following pseudocode:</p> <pre><code>func sync(c MatrixOneCluster) {\n  existingCNSets := Collect all CNSets for this cluster\n  for _, desired := range c.spec.CNSets {\n    cnSet := build CNSet(desired)\n    if _, ok := existingCNSets[cnSet.Name]; ok {\n      // 1. CNSet exist,update CNSet\n      ....\n      // 2. Marks this cnSet as needed in the desired state.\n      delete(existingCNSets, cnSet.Name)\n    } else {\n      // CNSet does not exist, create\n      ....\n    }\n  }\n  for _, orphan := range existingCNSets {\n    // Cleanup for CNSets that actually exist but do not exist in the desired state\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>More error-prone is ConfigMap / Secret's update logic. MO, like many apps, requires a configuration file and restarts to reread the configuration each time it is updated, which is usually stored with K8S native ConfigMap objects. One easy place to tread the pit is that the contents of the ConfigMap object are mutable, whereas most apps tend to read the configuration file within the ConfigMap only once at startup and never reload later. Therefore, viewing the content within the ConfigMap that the Pod is currently referencing does not determine the configuration that the Pod is currently using (it is possible that the ConfigMap content has changed since startup). Also, if you want to update your app on a rolling basis after a ConfigMap change, a common practice is to make a hash of the contents of the ConfigMap into the PodTemplate's Annotation and update this Annotation after each update of the ConfigMap change triggers a rolling update of your app. But this can also happen unexpectedly by modifying ConfigMap in place:</p> <p>For example, let's assume that the ConfigMap Hash in Annotation is updated from 123 to 321, and 321 is not ready after startup because of a problem with the ConfigMap configuration. At this point, with the right policy configuration, the rolling update will get stuck to avoid a wider failure range. However, a new version of ConfigMap has also been read within the Pod that has not yet been updated, and as soon as a container restart or Pod rebuild occurs, problems occur. This obviously doesn't behave the same as updating mirrors or other fields. When updating other fields, the green pod still belongs to the old ReplicaSet/ControllerRevision, neither reboot nor rebuild will start with the new version of the configuration, and the fault range is manageable.</p> <p>The root of the problem is that the contents of the ConfigMap are not within the spec of the Pod, and directly modifying the contents of the ConfigMap conflicts with the Pod's immutable infrastructure principles.</p> <p>Therefore, MatrixOne-Operator designs all objects that will be referenced within the Pod to be immutable. In the case of ConfigMap, each time a component's configuration is updated via CRD, MatrixOne-Operator generates a new ConfigMap and rolls all copies of the component onto this new ConfigMap:</p> <p>Based on this principle, at any given moment we can clarify the information within all Pods via the current Pod Spec. The problem of rolling updates is also solved.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-matrixone-operator/#application-state-management","title":"Application State Management","text":"<p>In addition to lifecycle management of the app itself, MatrixOne-Operator has an important responsibility to manage the state of the app itself. However, distributed systems often manage their own application state based on heartbeats or similar mechanisms, so why do you have to do this more in Operator?</p> <p>The reason is that Operator has knowledge of automated O&amp;M within its code, for example Operator knows exactly which Pod is to be rebuilt/restarted next during the rolling update process. So it's possible to adjust in-app status ahead of time, such as migrating loads on the Pod to minimize the impact of rolling updates. There are two common implementations of such application state management logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Synchronize app status within the Pod's own various lifecycle hooks, such as InitContainer, PostStart Hook, and PreStop Hook.</p> </li> <li> <p>Call the app interface within Operator's tuning loop to adjust the app state.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Mode 1 is simpler to implement, while Mode 2 is more self-contained and free to cope better with complex scenarios. For example, when shrinking a CNSet, migrate the session on the condensed CN Pod to another CN Pod before stopping the CN Pod. If this action is placed in Pod PreStop Hook, it cannot be undone. In the actual scenario, there is a set of CNs that are shrunk and then expanded before the shrunk is complete (especially after auto-scaling is turned on). At this point, the tuning loop within Operator can calculate that the CNs that are still offline can be directly multiplexed at this point, calling the management interface inside the MO to restore the CN to the service state, not migrating the session to the other CNs and accepting the new session back to the Proxy without having to expand a new CN.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-matrixone-operator/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>As a mainstream option to extend the orchestration capabilities of K8S, the Operator model has evolved to today have mature base libraries and tool chains, and there are plenty of mature open source projects in the community to reference.

However, at specific points in time, such as at night, at the end of the month, or at the end of the year, it is necessary to analyze the overall data over a period of time. At this time, if the user only has one database system, they will need to temporarily reduce the business load or conduct OLAP analytical tasks when the business load is low. However, in such cases, there are often problems like long analysis time and cannot affect the long running time of business. If users deploy a separate database system for OLAP analytical business, the actual analytical business is often difficult to maximize, leading to a specific waste of resources.</p> <p>As introduced in the previous section, MatrixOne achieves HTAP by grouping stateless computing nodes and supporting OLTP and OLAP business at the underlying layer through different links. This architecture allows MatrixOne to adjust resources flexibly.</p> <p>Allocation according to actual business needs increases machine utilization and achieves true cost-effectiveness. When CRUD-type business requirements are high, you can allocate more CN nodes to OLTP. In addition, when analytical business requirements increase, you can give more CN nodes to OLAP. These adjustments are fully dynamic and configurable.</p> <p>Take the following diagram as an example; suppose that the user needs 3 computing nodes to handle OLTP business and 3 computing nodes to handle OLAP business. And these hardware resources are fully bound, i.e., nodes serving OLTP cannot provide services for OLAP and vice versa. Moreover, users' planning for machine resources often exceeds the upper limit of actual demand. However, the time to reach the total peak demand is quite limited in real business. If you plan to use the MatrixOne cluster to support these businesses, you can adjust to 4 computing nodes; typically, 3 nodes handle OLTP business, and 1 node takes OLAP business. Then, at the end of the month or other periods when the demand for analysis is high, you can adjust to 1 computing node to handle the OLTP business and 3 computing nodes to run the OLAP business; after the peak period, you can return to the original configuration, thereby improving machine resource utilization by 40%.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/cost-effective/#efficient-and-low-cost-object-storage","title":"Efficient and Low-Cost Object Storage","text":"<p>At the storage level, MatrixOne mainly uses object storage.

It has its Cache, supporting random restarts and scaling; multiple Compute Nodes can calculate parallel to improve query efficiency.</li> <li>Transaction layer, composed of Transaction Node and Log Service, provides complete log service and metadata information, with built-in Logtail for storing recently written new data.</li> <li>Storage layer, all data are saved in object storage represented by S3, which achieves low-cost, infinitely expandable storage method.

The separation of the storage, transaction, and computing layers allows MatrixOne to expand nodes when encountering system resource bottlenecks flexibly. The storage layer is mainly based on object storage and partly based on the cache on the computing nodes (CN). The transaction layer is based on stateless transaction nodes (TN). The computing layer is based on stateless computing nodes (CN). The multi-node architecture can more effectively distribute resources and avoid hot spots and resource contention.</p> </li> <li> <p>Infinite Expansion Capability of S3 Object Storage: The core storage of MatrixOne is completely based on S3 object storage. S3 object storage has naturally high availability and infinite scalability, making MatrixOne highly scalable in data storage. No matter how the data scale grows, MatrixOne can meet the demand by expanding S3 storage. In a private deployment environment, MatrixOne builds S3 services based on the open-source MinIO component. MatrixOne can seamlessly utilize the object storage service provided by the public cloud in a public cloud environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stateless Computing and Transaction Nodes: MatrixOne's computing nodes (CN) and transaction nodes (TN) are stateless, meaning they can be horizontally expanded anytime. Stateless design means that computing and transaction nodes do not need to store any persistent data</p> </li> </ul> <p>They can be easily added or deleted to cope with different load requirements. This design makes MatrixOne extremely scalable and flexible when dealing with large-scale concurrent requests. (The current 1.0 version TN node does not yet have expansion capabilities, but the TN mainly handles transaction submission information, and the load is lower, so a single TN is enough to take a large-scale cluster, and subsequent versions will improve TN's scalability.)</p> <ul> <li>Independent Scaling for Different Workloads and Accounts: MatrixOne utilizes the Proxy module to group multiple compute nodes (CN) into managed sets known as CN Sets, achieved through labeling. This enables the independent scaling of each CN Set. Users can assign different CN Sets to distinct tenants, ensuring load isolation and separate scaling between tenants. It's also possible to give various CN Sets to diverse workloads, such as read and write workloads, or transactional and analytical workloads, thereby achieving isolation and separate scaling between them.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/stream/","title":"Stream","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/stream/#features-of-streaming-data","title":"Features of streaming data","text":"<p>With the rise of real-time data analytics, streaming data is becoming increasingly important in several areas.

MatrixOne draws on Snowflake's computational separation design for cloud-native data warehouses, completely handing over storage to shared storage on the cloud, while fully building the compute layer into a stateless container. At the same time, to accommodate the processing of fast write requests by OLTP-type loads, MatrixOne adds the concepts of TN and LogService to support high-frequency writes with block storage, ensures high availability of write log WALs with Raft triple copy consistency guarantee, and asynchronously drops WALs into shared storage. Unlike SingleStore, which extends from the Share-nothing architecture to cloud-native memory separation, it only puts cold data in shared storage (see SingleStore architecture paper) and still requires data fragmentation and rebalancing. MatrixOne, on the other hand, is consistent with Snowflake and is entirely based on shared storage without any data fragmentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>In terms of load types, MatrixOne uses HTAP as its basic core and gradually expands into a variety of load types such as stream computing, timing processing, machine learning, and search. On HTAP's technical route, MatrixOne differs from the TiDB-based dual storage and compute engine route in that MatrixOne implements HTAP directly on a single storage and compute engine, and the storage engine is also a disk drop-row-row-row-row-row-row-row-only architecture, which is also more consistent with SingleStore. Technical routes such as TiDB require internal dual-engine data synchronization, while TP and AP data need to be stored separately, while MatrixOne does not need to do this synchronization and multiple storage. Compared to SingleStore, which already has good support for a variety of business types other than HTAP for streaming computing, search, GIS, machine learning, etc., MatrixOne itself evolved late and is currently less well supported for other load types other than HTAP.</p> </li> <li>Experience-wise, MatrixOne has MySQL as its core compatibility goal, including full MySQL compatibility from transport protocols, SQL syntax, and basic functionality. MatrixOne only has its own unique syntax on capabilities that MySQL does not support, such as streaming writes, vector types, etc. Meanwhile MySQL has some advanced capabilities such as triggers, stored procedures, etc. MatrixOne is not yet supported due to low user usage.

The OLTP database is used to process a large number of short-term transactions, which are typically routine business operations such as order processing, inventory management, banking transactions, etc. It provides high concurrency performance and real-time data processing to meet the needs of enterprises for instant data access.</p> <p>The main features of an OLTP database are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>ACID: The OLTP system must ensure that the entire transaction is properly logged. Transactions typically involve the execution of programs that perform multiple steps or operations. It may be done when all interested parties confirm a transaction, deliver a product/service, or make a certain number of updates to a particular table in the database. Transactions are only properly documented when all steps involved are performed and documented. If there are any errors in any one step, the entire transaction must be aborted and all steps removed from the system. Therefore, OLTP systems must comply with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Persistence (ACID) to ensure the accuracy of data in the system.</li> <li>High Concurrency: The user base of OLTP systems can be very large, with many users attempting to access the same data simultaneously. The system must ensure that all users attempting to read or write to the system can do so simultaneously. Concurrency control ensures that two users accessing the same data in a database system at the same time will not be able to change that data, or that one user will have to wait for another user to complete processing before changing the data.</li> <li>High availability: OLTP systems must always be available and ready to accept transactions. Failure to process a transaction may result in loss of revenue or legal implications. Transactions can be executed anywhere in the world at any time, so the system must be available 24/7.</li> <li> <p>Fine-grained data access: OLTP databases, which typically provide data access in units of records, support efficient add, delete, and change operations and provide fast transaction commit and rollback capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>High reliability: OLTP systems must be resilient in the event of any hardware or software failure.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/matrixone-vs-other_databases/matrixone-vs-oltp/#classification-of-oltp-systems-in-the-current-industry","title":"Classification of OLTP systems in the current industry","text":"<p>OLTP databases can also be divided into centralized databases, distributed databases, and cloud-native databases depending on the architecture and technical route.</p> <ul> <li>Most well-known OLTP databases are traditional centralized databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, etc. Most were born between 1980 and 2000.</li> <li>Typical of Google's 2012 Spanner, the distributed OLTP database uses Share-nothing as the architecture core, scaling through multi-machine data slicing and computing, and distributed consistency through consistency protocols. This architecture is also referred to by many in the industry as NewSQL architecture, representing products such as CockroachDB, SAP HANA, TiDB, Oceanbase, etc.</li> <li>There is also a technical route known as cloud-native OLTP databases such as Aurora, PolarDB, NeonDB, etc. Significantly different from the Share-nothing architecture is the adoption of a shared storage architecture with a more thorough separation of memory and scalability through storage systems with their own scalability in cloud computing systems. MatrixOne is also a cloud-native technology route.</li> </ul> <p>It is worth noting that there are no strict dividing criteria for these three classifications, and each database has gradually begun to integrate the capabilities of other route products as it has evolved in practice. Oracle's RAC architecture, for example, is a typical shared storage architecture with some scalability. Products like CockroachDB and TiDB are also evolving toward cloud-native and shared storage.

By using the correct index type, selecting the right index columns, avoiding excessive indexing, and regularly rebuilding indexes, you can maximize the use of indexes to improve performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Query optimization: By optimizing the structure of queries, avoiding unnecessary subqueries, using more efficient JOIN statements, and avoiding using OR operators, you can reduce the time and resources required for queries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Table structure optimization: Optimizing table structure, such as selecting the correct data types, avoiding NULL values, using appropriate constraints and default values, normalization, and denormalization, can reduce storage space and query time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data volume control: By limiting the amount of data returned, paging, caching, using stored procedures, and other methods, you can reduce the time and resources required for queries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server configuration optimization: By increasing server memory, adjusting database parameters, regularly cleaning logs and caches, and other methods, you can improve database performance and response time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monitoring and debugging: Using database performance monitoring tools, debugging SQL queries, viewing database logs and error messages, and other methods can help identify and resolve performance issues.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It should be noted that SQL performance tuning is a complex process that requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as database structure, data volume, and query patterns. Continuous testing and validation of optimization results are also necessary to ultimately improve database performance and response time.</p> <p>When executing SQL statements in MatrixOne, the system automatically plans and selects the optimal execution plan rather than simply querying according to the SQL statements. Currently, MatrixOne supports performance tuning through EXPLAIN interpretation of the execution plan and optimizing the physical arrangement of tables. To help you better tune SQL queries in MatrixOne, you can refer to the following documents on execution plans:</p> <ul> <li>MatrixOne Query Execution Plan Overview: Describes the concepts of MatrixOne execution plans.</li> <li>Using EXPLAIN to learn the execution plan: Describes how to use the EXPLAIN statement to understand how MatrixOne executes a query.</li> <li>Performance Tuning Best Practices: Describes the best practices of using Cluster by in MatrixOne for performance tuning and learning how to improve query performance.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/control-execution-plan/optimizer-hints/","title":"Optimizer Hints","text":"<p>When you determine the problems in the execution plan, such as when the optimizer chooses a query plan that is not optimal, you can use Optimizer Hints to control the generation of the execution plan.</p> <p>The <code>Hint</code> hint command tells the query optimizer how to execute the query statement. By using hints, you can provide queries with information about how to access data to improve query performance. The <code>Hint</code> hint directive often tunes large or complex queries.</p> <p>Hints can be used to modify the execution plan of a query, including choosing a different index, using a different <code>JOIN</code> algorithm, changing the join order, etc. </p> <p>Hints in SQL use comment syntax, and specific comments can be added to query statements to specify hints.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/control-execution-plan/optimizer-hints/#syntax","title":"Syntax","text":"<pre><code>{DELETE|INSERT|SELECT|UPDATE} /*+ hint [text] [hint[text]]... */\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/control-execution-plan/optimizer-hints/#explanations","title":"Explanations","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>DELETE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>SELECT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> are keywords of SQL statements.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>/*+ */</code> is a comment symbol in the SQL statement.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>hint</code> is the specific instruction for hinting.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>text</code> is the argument to the prompt command.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Here are some commonly used SQL hints:</p> <p><code>/*+ INDEX (table index) */</code>: Specifies to use a specific index to execute the query.</p> <p><code>/*+ FULL (table) */</code>: Specifies to perform a full table scan instead of using an index.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/control-execution-plan/optimizer-hints/#scenarios","title":"Scenarios","text":"<ul> <li> <p>When the query optimizer chooses an inappropriate execution plan, you can use the <code>hint</code> hint to specify a better execution plan.

For example, using indexes can become slow when query conditions are too broad. In this case, the following hint syntax can be used to choose to use a full table scan or an index scan:</p> <pre><code>SELECT /*+ INDEX(table_name index_name) */ column_name FROM table_name WHERE ...\n</code></pre> <p>Among them, table_name is the table name, index_name is the index name, and column_name is the column name.

The query will use a full table scan if no index name is specified.</p> <ul> <li>Optimize the order of multi-table joins:</li> </ul> <p>When a query involves multiple tables, the query optimizer will try to choose the optimal join order. However, in some cases, the optimizer may be unable to select the optimal join order, resulting in degraded query performance.

Therefore, the resource size of the CN node is proportional to the computing power. The most direct expansion method is to expand the resources of a single CN node vertically. At the same time, the queried data is stored in the CN cache as hot data. If the cache is hit, the query can be returned directly from the cache without obtaining cold data from the object store. After the upper capacity limit is exceeded, the cache will only replace the data with the LRU algorithm, so the cache size is also helpful for improving performance.</p> <p>In addition, we can also improve performance by horizontally expanding CN nodes. The horizontal expansion has two technical characteristics that can improve performance. First, multiple user connection requests can be dispersed to different CN nodes, spreading the load on each CN. Secondly, other CN nodes also have different caches. When the CN node that receives the query request finds that the request data is not in its cache, it will find the CN node containing the request data cache through the metadata and forward the request to it for processing to improve the cache hit rate.</p> <p>The expansion of the MatrixOne distributed cluster components can be done through the Operator.

Here are some common use cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data Validation: Regular expressions can validate whether data complies with a specific format, such as checking whether a field contains a valid email address, phone number, or social security number. For example, you can use a regular expression to find all email addresses that do not conform to the standard format:</p> <pre><code>SELECT email\nFROM users\nWHERE email NOT REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$';\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Data Filtering: Regular expressions can be used to search for data that contains or does not contain specific patterns. For example, if you want to find all phone numbers that start with a specific prefix, you can use a regular expression to match these numbers:</p> <pre><code>SELECT phone_number\nFROM users\nWHERE phone_number REGEXP '^180';\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Data Cleaning: Regular expressions are also instrumental in data cleaning. For example, you may need to clear special characters and spaces or extract numbers from strings; regular expressions can quickly implement these functions:</p> <pre><code>SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(name, '[^a-zA-Z]', '')\nFROM users;\n</code></pre> <p>This SQL will return the result of all non-alphabetical characters in the name field being replaced.</p> </li> <li> <p>Text Analysis: If you are conducting text analysis, regular expressions can help you find specific words or phrases in the text and can even be used for certain forms of natural language processing.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Functions-and-Operators/String/Regular-Expressions/Regular-Expression-Functions-Overview/#special-characters","title":"Special Characters","text":"<p>Regular expressions use POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) extended regular expressions.

When you insert a value of NULL (recommended) or 0 into an indexed AUTO_INCREMENT column, the column is set to the next sequence value. Typically this is value+1, where the value is the largest value for the column currently in the table. <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> sequences begin with 1 default.</p> <p>There can be only one <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column per table, which must be indexed and cannot have a DEFAULT value. An <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column works properly only if it contains only positive values. Inserting a negative number is regarded as inserting a very large positive number. This is done to avoid precision problems when numbers \"wrap\" over from positive to negative and also to ensure that you do not accidentally get an <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column that contains 0.</p> <p>You can use the <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> attribute to define the starting value of an auto-increment column. If you want to set the starting value of the auto-increment column to 10, you can use the <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> keyword when creating the table and specify the starting value later.</p> <p>For example, to create a table and define an auto-increment column with a starting value of 10, you can use the following SQL statement:</p> <pre><code>-- set up\ncreate table t1(a int auto_increment primary key) auto_increment = 10;\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the <code>id</code> column is an auto-incrementing column with a starting value 10. When a new record is inserted into the table, the value of the <code>id</code> column will start from 10 and increment by 1 each time. If the starting value of <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> is not specified, the default starting value is 1, which is automatically incremented by 1 each time.</p> <p>Note</p> <ol> <li>MatrixOne currently only supports the default increment step size of 1; regardless of the initial value of the auto-increment column, each auto-increment is 1.

These two parameters are primarily used to maintain data integrity and consistency:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>ON DELETE reference_option</code>: This parameter specifies how to handle associated foreign key data when data in the referenced table is deleted. Common options include:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>RESTRICT</code>: If related foreign key data exists in the referenced table, deletion of data in the table is not allowed. This prevents accidental deletion of related data, ensuring data consistency.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>CASCADE</code>: When data in the referenced table is deleted, associated foreign key data is also deleted. This is used for cascading deletion of related data to maintain data integrity.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>SET NULL</code>: When data in the referenced table is deleted, the value of the foreign key column is set to NULL. This is used to retain foreign key data while disconnecting it from the referenced data upon deletion.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>NO ACTION</code>: Indicates no action is taken; it only checks for the existence of associated data. This is similar to <code>RESTRICT</code> but may have minor differences in some databases.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>ON UPDATE reference_option</code>: This parameter specifies how to handle associated foreign key data when data in the referenced table is updated. Common options are similar to those of <code>ON DELETE reference_option</code>, and their usage is identical, but they apply to data update operations.</p> </li> </ul> <p>See the example below:</p> <p>Suppose there are two tables, <code>Orders</code> and <code>Customers</code>, where the <code>Orders</code> table has a foreign key column <code>customer_id</code> referencing the <code>id</code> column in the <code>Customers</code> table. If, when a customer is deleted from the <code>Customers</code> table, you also want to delete the associated order data, you can use <code>ON DELETE CASCADE</code>.</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE Customers (\nid INT PRIMARY KEY,\nname VARCHAR(50)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Orders (\nid INT PRIMARY KEY,\norder_number VARCHAR(10),\ncustomer_id INT,\nFOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE\n);\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, when a customer is deleted from the <code>Customers</code> table, the associated order data will also be deleted through cascading, maintaining data integrity. Similarly, the <code>ON UPDATE</code> parameter can handle update operations.</p> <p>For more information on data integrity constraints, see Data Integrity Constraints Overview.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/create-table/#cluster-by","title":"Cluster by","text":"<p><code>Cluster by</code> is a command used to optimize the physical arrangement of a table.

The anchor member should come before the first recursive member, and you can define multiple anchor and recursive members. All CTE query definitions are considered anchor members unless they reference the CTE itself.</p> <p>Suppose you have a table named <code>Employee</code> that contains employee information, including fields like <code>EmployeeID</code>, <code>Name</code>, and <code>ManagerID</code>, representing the employee's ID, name, and ID of their manager. You can use a recursive CTE to query the hierarchical relationship between employees and subordinates.</p> <p>Assuming the table data is as follows:</p> EmployeeID Name ManagerID 1 Alice NULL 2 Bob 1 3 Charlie 1 4 David 2 5 Eve 2 6 Frank 3 <p>Here's an example of using a recursive CTE to query the hierarchical relationship between employees and their subordinates:</p> <pre><code>WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (\n-- Anchor member: Find top-level employees\nSELECT EmployeeID, Name, ManagerID, 0 AS Level\nFROM Employee\nWHERE ManagerID IS NULL\n\nUNION ALL\n\n-- Recursive member: Recursively query subordinate employees\nSELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, e.ManagerID, eh.Level + 1\nFROM Employee AS e\nJOIN EmployeeHierarchy AS eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID\n)\nSELECT Name, Level\nFROM EmployeeHierarchy;\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example:</p> <ul> <li>The anchor member selects top-level employees (with <code>ManagerID</code> as NULL) and sets their level (<code>Level</code>) to 0.</li> <li>The recursive member queries subordinate employees based on the previous round's results (<code>EmployeeHierarchy</code>), incrementing the level.</li> <li>The final query uses <code>SELECT</code> to retrieve employee names and levels from the recursive CTE.</li> </ul> <p>Executing this query will provide information about the hierarchical relationship between employees and their subordinates.

Actually two numbers are shown here: the startup cost before returning the first row, and the total cost of returning all rows. For most queries, the total cost is the most important, but in subqueries in <code>EXISTS</code>, the scheduler chooses the smallest start-up cost over the smallest total cost (because the performer stops after getting a row). In addition, if you limit the number of rows returned with a <code>LIMIT</code> clause, the scheduler will interpolate the endpoint costs appropriately to estimate which plan is really cheapest.</p> <p>The <code>ANALYZE</code> clause syntax option adds actual runtime statistics to the display for statement actual execution, not just scheduled execution, including the total run time (in milliseconds) spent in each scheduled node and the total number of rows actually returned.

This means that if the new statement contains an error and cannot be prepared, an error is returned and no statement with the given name exists.</p> <p>The scope of a prepared statement is the session within which it is created, which as several implications:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A prepared statement created in one session is not available to other sessions.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a session ends, whether normally or abnormally, its prepared statements no longer exist. If auto-reconnect is enabled, the client is not notified that the connection was lost. For this reason, clients may wish to disable auto-reconnect.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A parameter used in a prepared statement has its type determined when the statement is first prepared, and retains this type whenever <code>EXECUTE</code> is invoked for this prepared statement. Rules for determining a parameter's type are listed here:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a binary arithmetic operator has the same data type as the other operand.</p> </li> <li> <p>If both operands of a binary arithmetic operator are parameters, the type of the parameters is decided by the context of the operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is the operand of a unary arithmetic operator, the parameter's type is decided by the context of the operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>If an arithmetic operator has no type-determining context, the derived type for any parameters involved is <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>. This can happen, for example, when the parameter is a top-level node in a <code>SELECT</code> list, or when it is part of a comparison operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a character string operator has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the other operands. If all operands of the operator are parameters, the derived type is <code>VARCHAR;</code> its collation is determined by the value of <code>collation_connection</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a temporal operator has type DATETIME if the operator returns a <code>DATETIME</code>, <code>TIME</code> if the operator returns a <code>TIME</code>, and <code>DATE</code> if the operator returns a <code>DATE</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a binary comparison operator has the same derived type as the other operand of the comparison.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter that is an operand of a ternary comparison operator such as <code>BETWEEN</code> has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the other operands.</p> </li> <li> <p>If all operands of a comparison operator are parameters, the derived type for each of them is <code>VARCHAR</code>, with collation determined by the value of <code>collation_connection</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter that is an output operand of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF, IFNULL, or NULLIF has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the operator's other output operands.</p> </li> <li> <p>If all output operands of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF, IFNULL, or NULLIF are parameters, or they are all NULL, the type of the parameter is decided by the context of the operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the parameter is an operand of any of CASE, COALESCE(), IF, or IFNULL, and has no type-determining context, the derived type for each of the parameters involved is VARCHAR, and its collation is determined by the value of collation_connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is the operand of a CAST() has the same type as specified by the CAST().</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is not part of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is VARCHAR, and its collation is determined by the value of collation_connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is part of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type of the corresponding column into which the parameter is inserted.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is used as source for an assignment in a SET clause of an UPDATE statement or in the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type of the corresponding column which is updated by the SET or ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is an argument of a function, the derived type depends on the function's return type.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For some combinations of actual type and derived type, an automatic repreparation of the statement is triggered. Repreparation does not occur if any of the following conditions are true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>NULL is used as the actual parameter value.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter is an operand of a CAST(). (Instead, a cast to the derived type is attempted, and an exception raised if the cast fails.)</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter is a string. (In this case, an implicit CAST(? AS derived_type) is performed.)</p> </li> <li> <p>The derived type and actual type of the parameter are both INTEGER and have the same sign.</p> </li> <li> <p>The parameter's derived type is DECIMAL and its actual type is either DECIMAL or INTEGER.</p> </li> <li> <p>The derived type is DOUBLE and the actual type is any numeric type.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both the derived type and the actual type are string types.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the derived type is temporal and the actual type is temporal. Exceptions: The derived type is TIME and the actual type is not TIME; the derived type is DATE and the actual type is not DATE.</p> </li> <li> <p>The derived type is temporal and the actual type is numeric.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For cases other than those just listed, the statement is reprepared and the actual parameter types are used instead of the derived parameter types.</p> <p>These rules also apply to a user variable referenced in a prepared statement.</p> <p>Using a different data type for a given parameter or user variable within a prepared statement for executions of the statement subsequent to the first execution causes the statement to be reprepared. This is less efficient; it may also lead to the parameter's (or variable's) actual type to vary, and thus for results to be inconsistent, with subsequent executions of the prepared statement. For these reasons, it is advisable to use the same data type for a given parameter when re-executing a prepared statement.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/Prepared-Statements/prepare/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>&gt; create table t13 (a int primary key);\n&gt; insert into t13 values (1);\n&gt; select * from t13 where 3 in (select (1+1) union select 1);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\n&gt; select * from t13 where 3 in (select (1+2) union select 1);\n+------+\n| a    |\n+------+\n|    1 |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\n&gt; prepare st_18492 from 'select * from t13 where 3 in (select (1+1) union select 1)';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; execute st_18492;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\n&gt; prepare st_18493 from 'select * from t13 where 3 in (select (2+1) union select 1)';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; execute st_18493;\n+------+\n| a    |\n+------+\n|    1 |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; deallocate prepare st_18492;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; deallocate prepare st_18493;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/","title":"SHOW ACCOUNTS","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#function-description","title":"Function description","text":"<p>Lists meta-information and statistics for tenant users created under your account.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#function-syntax","title":"Function syntax","text":"<pre><code>&gt; SHOW ACCOUNTS;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#tenant-user-information-details","title":"Tenant user information details","text":"Column Name Information Type Data Source ACCOUNT_NAME tenant name varchar mo_account ADMIN_NAME Default super administrator name when created varchar In the mo_user table under each tenant CREATED_TIME Creation time timestamp mo_account STATUS Current status, OPEN or SUSPENDED varchar mo_account SUSPENDED_TIME Suspension time timestamp mo_account DB_COUNT Number of databases bigint unsigned mo_tables TBL_COUNT Number of tables bigint unsigned mo_tables SIZE Total space used (MB) decimal(29,3) sum(mo_table_size(mt.reldatabase,mt.relname) SNAPSHOT_SIZE Backup data storage size (MB) -- -- COMMENTS COMMENT information when created varchar mo_account"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#example","title":"Example","text":"<pre><code>mysql&gt; show accounts;\n+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-----------+----------+---------------+----------------+\n| account_name | admin_name | created_time        | status | suspended_time | db_count | tbl_count | size     | snapshot_size | comments       |\n+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-----------+----------+---------------+----------------+\n| sys          | root       | 2024-12-06 03:37:02 | open   | NULL           |        7 |       108 | 3.188068 |             0 | system account |\n+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-----------+----------+---------------+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-collation/","title":"SHOW COLLATION","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-collation/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>This statement lists collations supported by MatrixOne.

Non_unique 0 if the index cannot contain duplicates, 1 if it can. Key_name The name of the index. If the index is the primary key, the name is always PRIMARY. Seq_in_index The column sequence number in the index, starting with 1. Column_name The column name. See also the description for the Expression column. Collation How the column is sorted in the index. This can have values A (ascending), D (descending), or NULL (not sorted). Cardinality An estimate of the number of unique values in the index. To update this number, run ANALYZE TABLE or (for MyISAM tables) myisamchk -a.Cardinality is counted based on statistics stored as integers, so the value is not necessarily exact even for small tables. The higher the cardinality, the greater the chance that MySQL uses the index when doing joins. Sub_part The index prefix. That is, the number of indexed characters if the column is only partly indexed, NULL if the entire column is indexed.  Note: Prefix limits are measured in bytes. However, prefix lengths for index specifications in CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and CREATE INDEX statements are interpreted as number of characters for nonbinary string types (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT) and number of bytes for binary string types (BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB). Take this into account when specifying a prefix length for a nonbinary string column that uses a multibyte character set. Packed Indicates how the key is packed. NULL if it is not. Null Contains YES if the column may contain NULL values and '' if not. Index_type The index method used (BTREE, FULLTEXT, HASH, RTREE). Comment Information about the index not described in its own column, such as disabled if the index is disabled. Visible Whether the index is visible to the optimizer. Expression For a nonfunctional key part, Column_name indicates the column indexed by the key part and Expression is NULL.For a functional key part, Column_name column is NULL and Expression indicates the expression for the key part."},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-index/#syntax","title":"Syntax","text":"<pre><code>&gt;

We have also adjusted the timeout mechanism of some modules to prevent the system from becoming unresponsive during extreme cases, such as data import and restart. Additionally, we have fixed the issue where a single module failure in the distributed architecture would cause a system-wide collapse.</p> <p>To enhance performance, this iteration has focused on read and write optimization. For reading, we have implemented Zonemap-based statistical information and provided a better execution plan. We have also added the Cluster by field when creating a table to arrange data in advance, making it easier to obtain data faster. Furthermore, we have optimized many performance bottlenecks, including the IN operator, type conversion, and predicate filtering. As for writing, this iteration has achieved many parallel writes to shared storage directly through the CN node, greatly improving loading performance.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Release-Notes/v23.0.7.0/#docker","title":"Docker","text":"<pre><code>docker pull matrixorigin/matrixone:0.7.0\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Release-Notes/v23.0.7.0/#features","title":"Features","text":"<ul> <li>Support parallel load data mode.</li> <li>Support <code>Foreign Key</code>.</li> <li>Support adding <code>Cluster by</code> in DDL statements.</li> <li>Add a MYSQL_COMPATBILITY_MODE to manage MySQL-compatible behaviors.</li> <li>Modify the system default isolation level parameter to <code>REPEATABLE_READ</code> for better MySQL compatibility.</li> <li>Improve <code>Unique Index</code> behavior.</li> <li>Support to load data from the client machine.</li> <li>Support <code>Alter View</code>.</li> <li>Add query_result() function to get saved query results.</li> <li>Support account suspending.</li> <li>Support system table sharing to accounts.</li> <li>Support aggregate function <code>group_concat</code>.</li> <li>Support built-in functions: <code>format</code>, <code>replace</code>, <code>curdate</code>, <code>field</code>, <code>substring_index</code>, and other system functions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Release-Notes/v23.0.7.0/#known-issues","title":"Known Issues","text":"<ul> <li>0.7.0 data format is not compatible with the previous versions.</li> <li>Transactional performance doesn't compete with mature DBMS products.</li> <li>The concurrent performance of OLTP type load is unstable.</li> <li>Secondary Key doesn't improve any performance.</li> <li>Only support up to 100GB benchmark testing.</li> <li>Out of memory(OOM) error or context deadline will occur after 5 hours of frequent testing.</li> <li>Loading multiple GB-level large tables in a distributed cluster will cause OOM problems.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Release-Notes/v23.0.7.0/#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":"<p>This release includes 656 commits by 43 authors.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Release-Notes/v23.0.7.0/#new-contributors","title":"New Contributors","text":"<ul> <li>@sourcelliu</li> <li>@iceTTTT</li> <li>@chrisxu333</li> <li>@songjiayang</li> <li>@dr-lab</li> <li>@arjunsk</li> <li>@Morranto</li> </ul> <p>We appreciate your contribution!

It needs to be granted to a user. In a account, the user cannot perform any operations if a user is not granted a role.</p> <p>Role is set up to save the operation cost of granting the same authority. The three privileges p1, p2, and p3 must be granted to users u1, u2, and u3. You only need to grant p1, p2, and p3 to role r1 first, then grant role r1 to users u1, u2, and u3 simultaneously. It is easier to operate than granting each privilege to each user separately, and this advantage will become more obvious as the number of users and privileges increases. At the same time, the emergence of roles further abstracts the privilege set and its relationship, which is also very convenient for later privilege maintenance.</p> <p>After the cluster and account (Account) are created, MatrixOne will automatically create some default roles and users (see the Initialization Access section below for details); these roles have the highest management authority and are used to manage the cluster and account at the beginning ( Account), we do not recommend that you grant these roles to users who execute SQL daily. Excessive privileges will introduce more security issues. Therefore, MatrixOne supports the creation of custom roles. You can customize roles according to the user's business needs and assign appropriate privileges to these roles.</p> <p>Highlights</p> <p>In MatrixOne, the behavior details of roles are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>A role can be granted multiple privileges.</li> <li>A role can be granted to multiple users.</li> <li> <p>A role can pass its privileges to another role.</p> <ul> <li>Use all the privileges of a role to another role; for example, pass all the privileges of role1 to role2, then role2 inherits the privileges of role1,</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Roles and users only take effect within their respective Account, including the Sys Account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <ol> <li>The privilege inheritance of roles is dynamic. If the privileges of the inherited role change, the scope of privileges inherited by the inherited role will also change dynamically.</li> <li>The inheritance relationship of roles cannot form a loop. For example, role1 inherits role2, role 2 inherits role3, and role3 inherits role1.</li> <li>The transfer of privileges between roles makes privilege management more convenient, but it also has risks. For this reason, MatrixOne only allows roles with Manage Grants privilege to do this kind of operation. This privilege is granted to the system default role MOADMIN by default or ACCOUNTADMIN, and it is not recommended to grant this privilege to a custom role when creating a new one.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Security/role-priviledge-management/about-privilege-management/#role-switching","title":"Role Switching","text":"<p>A user is granted multiple roles to perform different types of data services.</p> <p>Main role: The user can only use one of the roles at a particular moment; we call the currently used role main role.</p> <p>Secondary role: In addition to the main role, the set of other roles owned by the user is called the secondary role.</p> <p>By default, if a user wants to execute SQL with another role's privilege, he needs to switch roles first (Use SQL as <code>set role &lt;role&gt;</code>).

industry-standard benchmark for OLTP databases. TPC-C models a warehouse-centric order processing application, and the database used in the TPC-C benchmark consists of nine tables, such as Warehouse, Customer, Order, Item, and so on (See the below ER diagram). Except for the item table, each record is populated on a per-warehouse basis, and the number of warehouses can be configurable as a scale factor.</p> <p></p> <p>TPC-C has five transaction types: NewOrder, Payment, OrderStatus, Delivery, and StockLevel. The request rate of each transaction is defined in the specification, and almost 90% of transactions are NewOrder and Payment, which are write-intensive. TPC-C transactions mostly access a single (local) warehouse, but about 10% of transactions interact with another (remote) warehouse.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#before-you-start","title":"Before you start","text":"<p>Make sure you have already Deployed standalone MatrixOne.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#clone-mo-tpcc-repository","title":"Clone mo-tpcc repository","text":"<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tpcc.git\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#steps","title":"Steps","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This section will teach you how to generate the TPCC data, create TPCC tables, load data to MatrixOne, and run TPCC.</p> <p>Now you can execute commands step by step as the following descriptions.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#1-configure-the-propsmo-file","title":"1.

The proliferation of business systems and the increasing complexity of business logic have forced many companies to split their databases. However, this split architecture is difficult to implement complex correlation statistics and real-time analysis across shards due to the physical isolation between instances, which greatly limits the application potential of the database. To address these challenges, real-time data warehouse technology emerged. However, although real-time data warehouses provide solutions, the complexity and high cost of their architecture require enterprises to invest a lot of human resources in maintaining and building complex data synchronization links, which is not necessary in many cases. MatrixOne's HTAP Mixed Workload Engine provides a breakthrough solution. It seamlessly integrates online transaction processing and real-time data analysis capabilities through a single database core, thereby eliminating the need for data synchronization in traditional architectures. This integrated architecture design not only greatly simplifies the technical architecture and improves the efficiency of business processing, but also injects new vitality into the company's continuous innovation and efficiency improvement. The implementation of MatrixOne HTAP enables enterprises to respond to the dual challenges of data analysis and transaction processing more agilely, achieving instant analysis of data and rapid decision-making, while avoiding additional maintenance costs and technical complexity.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/htap-demo/#what-is-htap","title":"What is HTAP?","text":"<p>HTAP, or Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing, is a database architecture that can handle both transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) workloads within a single database system.

If you already created an index too early, use this monitoring tool to detect the issue and rebuild the index.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/ivf-index-health-demo/#why-index-creation-timing-matters","title":"\u26a0\ufe0f Why Index Creation Timing Matters","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/ivf-index-health-demo/#problems-with-early-index-creation","title":"\u274c Problems with Early Index Creation","text":"<p>If you create an IVF index when:</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udcc9 There is no data in the table</li> <li>\ud83d\udcc9 There is very little data (&lt; 100 vectors)</li> <li>\ud83d\udcc9 Data volume is much smaller than expected production size</li> </ul> <p>You may experience:</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udd34 Insufficient centroids: Not enough data to properly initialize all centroids</li> <li>\ud83d\udd34 Poor distribution: Vectors clustered unevenly across centroids</li> <li>\ud83d\udd34 Empty centroids: Some centroids never get assigned any vectors</li> <li>\ud83d\udd34 Degraded performance: Queries become slower as data grows</li> <li>\ud83d\udd34 Imbalanced load: Some centroids overloaded while others are empty</li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/ivf-index-health-demo/#recommended-approach","title":"\u2705 Recommended Approach","text":"<p>Best Practice:</p> <ol> <li>\u2705 Insert a representative amount of data first (at least 1000+ vectors)</li> <li>\u2705 Then create the IVF index with appropriate <code>lists</code> parameter</li> <li>\u2705 Use this health monitoring tool to evaluate index quality</li> <li>\u2705 Rebuild the index if health metrics indicate issues</li> </ol> <p>Example of Bad vs Good:</p> <pre><code># \u274c BAD: Create index on empty table\nclient.create_table(VectorDocument)\nclient.vector_ops.create_ivf(table_name, index_name, column_name, lists=100)\n# Then insert data later \u2192 Poor distribution!\n\n# \u2705 GOOD: Insert data first, then create index\nclient.create_table(VectorDocument)\nclient.batch_insert(VectorDocument, initial_data)  #

For example, when I asked Lu Xun about his relationship with Zhou Shuren, GPT started a serious nonsense.</p> <p>To solve the above problem, we can retrain the LLM model, but at a high cost. The main advantage of RAG, on the other hand, is that it avoids having to train again for specific tasks. Its high availability and low threshold make it one of the most popular scenarios in LLM systems, on which many LLM applications are built. The core idea of RAG is for the model to not only rely on what it learns during the training phase when generating responses, but also to utilize external, up-to-date, proprietary sources of information, so that users can optimize the output of the model by enriching the input with additional external knowledge bases based on the actual situation.</p> <p>RAG's workflow typically consists of the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Retrieve: Find and extract the information most relevant to the current query from a large data set or knowledge base.</li> <li>Augment: Combines retrieved information or data sets with the LLM to enhance the performance of the LLM and the accuracy of the output.</li> <li>Generate: Utilize LLM to generate new text or responses using retrieved information.</li> </ul> <p>The following is a flow chart for Native RAG:</p> <p>As you can see, the retrieval link plays a crucial role in the RAG architecture, and MatrixOne's ability to retrieve vectors provides powerful data retrieval support for building RAG applications.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/rag-demo/#role-of-matrixone-in-rag","title":"Role of Matrixone in RAG","text":"<p>As a hyperconverged database, Matrxione comes with its own vector capabilities, which play an important role in RAG applications in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Efficient information retrieval: Matrxione has vector data types specifically designed to process and store high-dimensional vector data.

Through the Transformers library, researchers and developers can easily use and integrate CLIP models into their projects.</p> <p>CLIP: The CLIP model is a deep learning model released by OpenAI. The core is to unify text and images through contrastive learning methods, so that tasks such as image classification can be completed through text-image similarity without the need for Optimize tasks directly. It can be combined with a vector database to build a tool for image (text) search. High-dimensional vector representations of images are extracted through the CLIP model to capture their semantic and perceptual features, and then these images are encoded into an embedding space. At query time, a sample image is passed through the same CLIP encoder to obtain its embedding, performing a vector similarity search to efficiently find the top k closest database image vectors.</p> <p>Streamlit: is an open source Python library designed to quickly build interactive and data-driven web applications. Its design goal is to be simple and easy to use. Developers can create interactive dashboards and interfaces with very little code, especially suitable for displaying machine learning models and data visualization.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Tutorial/search-picture-demo/#environment-preparation","title":"Environment Preparation","text":"<p>Before you begin, ensure you have downloaded and installed the following software:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Confirm that you have completed the Standalone Deployment of MatrixOne.</p> </li> <li> <p>Confirm that you have installed Python 3.8 (or later).

Spring Data JPA is an object\u2013relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.</li> <li>Intellij IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE for Java developers. It has a lot of plugins that can enhance our efficiency.</li> <li>Maven: Maven is a powerful management tool in Java that can automatically download and import Jar file according to the configuration in the pom.xml file. This feature reduces the conflicts between different versions of Jar files.</li> <li>Spring: Spring is one of the most popular frameworks in Java and more and more enterprise is using the Spring framework to build their project. Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional spring framework. So, it provides all the features of spring and is yet easier to use than spring.</li> <li>Postman: Postman is an application used for API testing.
