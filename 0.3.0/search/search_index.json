The MatrixOne documentation is managed in 3 repos: The main project framework and CI settings are in the matrixorigin.io repo. The markdown contents are in the docs/en/MatrixOne folder of matrixone repo. The images and unstructured data are located in the artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io repo contains a submodule which links to matrixone repo contents. The images are referred as webimage links from artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io has implemented a CI project, which will be triggered by a new code merge. This CI workflow publishs the documentation to https://docs.matrixorigin.io/. The documentation project is based on the mkdocs-material . You can find the corresponding syntax and commands with this project. How MatrixOne documentation content is organized? The MatrixOne documentation content is planned with 6 main modules. Overview: MatrixOne's introduction, features, architecture, tech design etc. Get Started: How to quickly deploy and run a MatrixOne in a standalone or a distributed environment. Develop: How to develop some applications based on MatrixOne using different programming language. Troubleshoot: Introduce common errors and debugging tools. Reference: SQL reference, Configuration parameters, Error Codes. FAQs: Product, Technical Design,SQL, Deployment FAQs. How to contribute to documentation project? Fork matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. Clone the matrixorigin.io repo, using --repository to retrieve the submodule of matrixone repo. $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/matrixorigin.io.git As the local repo has the full documentation project code, you can run mkdocs serve under matrixorigin.io folder, and check http://localhost:8000 to check if this project runs well. $ mkdocs serve Make your modification. If the modification is about the project settings, updating sitemap with new pages, or updating the CI workflow code. You can always check http://localhost:8000 to see if your modification is effective. If your modification is about the markdown contents, after you update the docs submodule of matrixorigin.io , the same modifcation should be applied to the matrixone repo. Push your git commits to your Github repos and make PR to matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. Once your code for both repos is merged, the CI workflow starts running until the documentation website being updated. What we are expecting? Anyone using MatrixOne or interested in MatrixOne is welcome to make contributions for the documentation. You can report confusing concepts, wrong descriptions or better organization format. For the 0.2.0 version, our SQLs and configuration settings are not fully tested, if you find contraints or errors, you are welcome to make your modifiction. The FAQs part is a onging project too, the ones who are more familiar with the project can contribute better answers.","title":"How MatrixOne documentation project is managed?"},{"location":"MatrixOne/documentation_contribution_guide/#how-matrixone-documentation-project-is-managed","text":"The MatrixOne documentation is managed in 3 repos: The main project framework and CI settings are in the matrixorigin.io repo.

Term Definition A AST (Abstract syntax tree) Abstract Syntax Trees or ASTs are tree representations of code. They are a fundamental part of the way a compiler works. C Cluster A distributed MatrixOne deployment, which acts as a single logical application. D Data Storage A DataStorage is an interface for implementing distributed storage service. It must be defined in prior to using MatrixCube. DataStorage needs to be implemented based on the characteristics of storage engine. E Event Notify The machanism of synchronizing heartbeat information to all nodes is called an event notify. F Factorization The factorization method uses basic factorization formula to reduce any algebraic or quadratic equation into its simpler form. MatrixOne uses compact factorised representations at the physical layer to reduce data redundancy and boost query performance. H Heartbeat Every node in a MatrixOne cluster will periodically sends its status information, this information is called a heartbeat. M MatrixCube MatrixCube is a framework for building distributed systems, which offers guarantees about reliability, consistency, and scalability. It is designed to facilitate distributed, stateful application building to allow developers only need to focus on the business logic on a single node. P Prophet Prophet is a scheduling module in MatrixCube. It takes charge of Auto-Rebalance, which keeps the system storage level and read/write throughput level balanced across Stores. The inital 3 Stores of a MatrixCube cluster are all Prophet Nodes. Pure Storage In contrast to Prophet, pure storage is another type of node, which doesn't handle any scheduling job and works as simple storage. R Replica To provide reliable service, each shard is stored not only once, it will have several copy stored in different stores. Every copy of a shard is called a Replica. S Snapshot Isolation (SI) Snapshot Isolation is a multi-version concurrency control approach that is widely used in practice. MatrixOne supports distributed transaction of snapshot isolation level. Store A MatrixCube distributed system consists of several physical servers, our data are stored across these physical server. We call each server inside this cluster a Store. Shard In MatrixOne, the data are split into different partitions to store in order to get better scalability. Each partition is called a Shard. In our design, a new created table is initially a Shard. When the size of the table exceeds the Shard size limit, the Shard will split. Shard Splitting There is a certain limit to a Shard size. Whenever a Shard exceeds its storage limit, MatrixCube splits a Shard into two Shards and keep each Shard with the same storage level. Shard Proxy The Shard Proxy is a central module to accept all user read/write requests and route requests to corresponding nodes. Concepts MatrixOne relies heavily on the following concepts. Being familiar with them will help you understand what our architecture achieves. Term Definition A Auto-Rebalance A modern distributed database should do more than just split data amongst a number of servers. The automatic process of storage and workload distribution among servers is called an Auto-Rebalance. C Consistency MatrixOne supports a strong consistency. It is guaranted that after any successful data write, the reading afterwards will get the latest value, no matter from which store. E Execution Plan An execution plan in a database is a simple graphical representation of the operations that the query optimizer generates to calculate the most efficient way to return a set of results. F Fault-Tolerance Fault-Tolerance simply means a system's ability to continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of one or more of its components. J JIT Compilation Turns SQL plan tree or Intermediate Representation code into a native program using LLVM at runtime. M Monolitic Engine A monolithic database engine is designed to support hybrid workloads: transactional, analytical, streaming, time-series, machine learning, etc. Materialized View A materialized view is a pre-computed data set derived from a query specification (the SELECT in the view definition) and stored for later use. Materialized view is usually used for increasing performance and efficiency. Metadata Metadata is the data that describes the structure and creation method of data in a database. P Paxos Paxos is an algorithm that is used to achieve consensus among a distributed set of computers that communicate via an asynchronous network. R Raft Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. Raft Group and Leader Raft defines a strong, single leader and number of followers in a group of peers. The group represents a replicated state machine. Only the leader may service client requests. The leader replicates actions to the followers. S SIMD instruction SIMD is short for Single Instruction/Multiple Data, while the term SIMD operations refers to a computing method that enables processing of multiple data with a single instruction. T Transaction A set of operations performed on your database that satisfy the requirements of ACID semantics. V Vectorized Execution Vectorized data processing helps with developing faster analytical query engines by making efficient utilization of CPU cache. Arrow's columnar format allows to use lightweight schemes like dictionary encoding, bit packing, and run length encoding, which favor query performance over compression ratio.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#glossary","text":"","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#terms","text":"It's helpful to understand a few terms before reading our architecture documentation.

The MatrixOne community strives to make the contribution process simple and straightforward. To do that, we create this page to walk you through the whole process step by step. Before you start Before you contribute please take a minute to familiarize yourself with basic Markdown syntax and have a look at our Code of Conduct and the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide for some guidance on how to write accessible, consistent, and inclusive documentation. How is MatrixOne documentation project organized? The MatrixOne documentation is managed in 3 repositories: The main project framework and CI&CD settings are in the matrixorigin.io repo. The markdown contents are in the docs/en/MatrixOne folder of matrixone repo. The images and unstructured data are located in the artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io repo contains a submodule that links to matrixone repo contents. The images are referred as web image links from artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io has implemented a CI&CD project, which will be triggered by a new code merge and manual launch. This CI&CD workflow publishes the documentation to https://docs.matrixorigin.io/ . The documentation project is based on the mkdocs-material . You can find the corresponding syntax and commands with this project. MatrixOne Documentation Structure The MatrixOne documentation content is planned with 6 main modules. Overview : MatrixOne's introduction, features, architecture, tech design. Get Started : How to quickly deploy and run a MatrixOne in a standalone or a distributed environment. Reference : SQL reference, Configuration parameters, Error Codes. FAQs : Product, Technical Design, SQL, Deployment FAQs. Develop : How to develop some applications based on MatrixOne using different programming languages. Troubleshoot : Introduce common errors and debugging tools. Release Notes : Release notes of all versions. Contribution Guide : How to contribute to MatrixOne project. Lift a finger If you are just correcting a typo or grammatical error, feel free to go ahead and create a pull request . Contribute Workflow 1 . File an issue and assign it to yourself by commenting /assign . 2 . Fork matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. 3 . Clone the matrixorigin.io repo, using --recursive to retrieve the submodule of matrixone repo. $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/matrixorigin.io.git Clone the matrixone repo to the other folder in local: $ git clone git@github.com:yourusername/matrixone.git 4 . Add matrixone repo as a remote repository in your local matrixone folder with: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git Add matrixorigin.io repo as a remote repository in your local matrixorigin.io folder with: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixorigin.io.git 5 . As the local repo has the full documentation project code, you can run mkdocs serve under matrixorigin.io folder, and check http://localhost:8000 to check if this project runs well. $ mkdocs serve 6 . Make your modification. If the modification is about the project settings, updating the sitemap with new pages, or updating the CI&CD workflow code. You can always check http://localhost:8000 to see if your modification is effective. If your modification is about the markdown contents, after you update the docs submodule of matrixorigin.io , the same modifcation should be applied to the matrixone repo. 7 . Push your git commits to your remote Github matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. We recommend you to push to a new branch using the following commands: git push origin main:NEW_BRANCH 8 . Go back to GitHub, and submit a pull request in NEW_BRANCH so that we can review your changes. 9 . Once your code for both repos is merged, you'll wait for a CI&CD workflow to restart running until the documentation website being updated. Note So once your pull requests are merged, the update to the website is not immediate. We'll need to run a manual launch to update it. 10 . At last, you should update your local and remote repo to help keep committing history clean. Override your local committing repo with: git pull --force upstream main:main Update the main branch of your remote repo in Github: git push --force origin main:main Note Most processes should be implemented in both matrixorigin.io and matrixone . Contribute a blog article If you would like to write an article for our blog, please file an issue or send it to dengnan@matrixorigin.io . Feel free to submit either a completed draft or article ideas. All submissions will be reviewed as quickly as possible. If your article or idea seems like a good fit for the blog, we will reach out to you directly.","title":"Contribute Documentation"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/How-to-Contribute/contribute-documentation/#contributing-to-matrixone-documentation","text":"Contributions to the MatrixOne documentation are welcome from everyone.

If your modification is about the markdown contents, after you update the docs submodule of matrixorigin.io , the same modifcation should be applied to the matrixone repo. 7 . Push your git commits to your remote Github matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. We recommend you to push to a new branch using the following commands: git push origin main:NEW_BRANCH 8 . Go back to GitHub, and submit a pull request in NEW_BRANCH so that we can review your changes. 9 . Once your code for both repos is merged, you'll wait for a CI&CD workflow to restart running until the documentation website being updated. Note So once your pull requests are merged, the update to the website is not immediate. We'll need to run a manual launch to update it. 10 . At last, you should update your local and remote repo to help keep committing history clean. Override your local committing repo with: git pull --force upstream main:main Update the main branch of your remote repo in Github: git push --force origin main:main Note Most processes should be implemented in both matrixorigin.io and matrixone .","title":"Contribute Workflow"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/How-to-Contribute/contribute-documentation/#contribute-a-blog-article","text":"If you would like to write an article for our blog, please file an issue or send it to dengnan@matrixorigin.io .

It's not necessary to doubt whether your review is constructive and useful enough because no matter how tiny, a suggestion may make a profound influence on MatrixOne. Certainly, before reviewing we wish you can browse this page to learn basic requirements and relative methods. Principles of the code review When you review a pull request, there are several rules and suggestions you should take to propose better comments. Regardless of the specifics, we suggest you stay friendly first: Keep respectful Keep respectful to every pull request author and other reviewers. Code review is a part of community activities so you should follow the community requirements. Be careful with tone It's be encouraged to try to frame your comments as suggestions or questions instead of commands. Once the tone becomes softer, your reviews will be easier to accept. Be generous with your compliments We recommended you offer encouragement and appreciation to the authors for their good practices in the code. In many cases, telling the authors what they did is right is even more valuable than telling them what they did is wrong. Additionally, there are also some suggestions on content: Provide more We encourage you to provide additional details and context of your review process as possible as you can. Undoubtedly, the more detailed your review, the more useful it will be to others. If your test the pull request, report the result and your test environment details. If you request some changes, try to suggest how. Keep objective Avoid individual biased opinions and subjective emotions. Of course, everyone will comment with more or less subjective opinions, however, as a good reviewer, you should consider the technique and data facts rather than your own personal preferences. Case by case It's difficult to decide whether it's more reasonable to accept or reject when you are faced with a complex problem. Regrettably, we can't provide a certain answer because it always depends on the specific situation, which asks you to balance the pros and cons. Classifying pull requests Some pull request authors may not be familiar with MatrixOne, MatriOne development workflow, or MatrixOne community. They don't know what labels should be added to the pull requests and which expert could be asked for a review. If you are able to, it would be great for you to triage the pull requests, add suitable labels to the pull requests, asking corresponding experts to review the pull requests. These actions could help more contributors notice the pull requests and make quick responses. Checking pull requests There are some basic aspects to check when you review a pull request: Concentration One pull request should only do one thing. No matter how small it is, the change does exactly one thing and gets it right. Don't mix other changes into it. Tests A pull request should be test covered, whether the tests are unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. Tests should be sufficient, correct and don't slow down the CI pipeline largely. Functionality The pull request should implement what the author intends to do, fit well in the existing code base, and resolve a real problem for users. Thus you should check whether or not the pull request achieve the intention and you could follow the discussions in the corresponding GitHub issue . Style Code in the pull request should follow common programming style . However, sometimes the existing code is inconsistent with the style guide, you should maintain consistency with the existing code or file a new issue to fix the existing code style first. Documentation If a pull request changes how users build, test, interact with, or release code, you must check whether it also updates the related documentation such as README.md and any generated reference docs. Similarly, if a pull request deletes or deprecates code, you must check whether or not the corresponding documentation should also be deleted. Performance If you find the pull request may affect performance, you could ask the author to provide a benchmark result.","title":"Review a Pull Request"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/How-to-Contribute/review-a-pull-request/#reviews","text":"For MatrixOne, any type of review for a pull request is crucial, where you can classify the pull request to help look for more suitable experts to solve relative problems or propose your suggestions to codes for not only contents but style.

You can go through this excellent Golang tutorial to get some Golang basic concepts. Preparation Before you start, please make sure that you have Go installed, cloned the MatrixOne code base. Please refer to Preparation and Contribute Code for more details. What is an aggregation function? In database systems, an aggregate function or aggregation function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together to form a single summary value. Common aggregate functions include: COUNT counts how many rows are in a particular column. SUM adds together all the values in a particular column. MIN and MAX return the lowest and highest values in a particular column, respectively. AVG calculates the average of a group of selected values. Aggregate function in MatrixOne As MatrixOne's one major key feature, via factorisation, the database join in MatrixOne is highly efficient and less redundant in comparison with other state-of-the-art databases. Therefore, many operations in MatrixOne need to be adapted to the factorisation method, in order to improve efficiency when performing join . Aggregate function is an important one among those operations. To implement aggragate function in MatrixOne, we design a data structure named Ring . Every aggregate function needs to implement the Ring interface in order to be factorised when join occurs. For the common aggregate function AVG as an example, we need to calculate the number of groups and their total numeric sum, then get an average result, which is the common practice for any database design. But when a query with join occurs for two tables, the common method is to get a Cartesian product by joining tables first, then perform an AVG with that Cartesian product, which is an expensive computational cost as Cartesian product can be very large. In MatrixOne's implementation, the factorisation method pushs down the calculation of group statistic and sum before the join operation is performed. This method helps to reduce a lot in computational and storage cost. This factorisation is realized by the Ring interface and its inner functions. To checkout more about the factorisation theory and factorized database, please refer to Principles of Factorised Databases . What is a Ring Ring is an important data structure for MatrixOne factorisation, as well as an mathematical algebraic concept with a clear definition . An algebraic Ring is a set equipped with two binary operations + (addition) and \u22c5 (multiplication) satisfying several axioms. A Ring in MatrixOne is an interface, with several functions similar to the algebraic Ring structure. We use Ring interface to implement aggragate functions, the + (addition) is defined as merging two Ring s groups, the \u22c5 (multiplication) operation is defined as the computation of a grouped aggregate value combined with its grouping key frequency information. Method of Ring Interface Do What Count Return the number of groups Size Return the memory size of Ring Dup Duplicate a Ring of same type Type Return the type of a Ring String Return some basic information of Ring for execution plan log Free Free the Ring memory Grow Add a group for the Ring Grows Add multiple groups for the Ring SetLength Shrink the size of Ring, keep the first N groups Shrink Shrink the size of Ring, keep the designated groups Eval Return the eventual result of the aggregate function Fill Update the data of Ring by a row BulkFill Update all the data of Ring BatchFill Update part of data of Ring Add Add a couple of groups for two Rings BatchAdd Add several couples of groups for two Rings Mul Multiplication between groups for two Rings, called when join occurs The implementation of Ring data structure is under /pkg/container/ring/ . How does Ring work with query: To better understand the Ring interface, we can take aggregate function sum() as an example. We'll walk you through the whole process of Ring . There are two different scenarios for aggregation functions with Ring s. 1. Query with single table. In the single table scenario, when we run the below query, it generates one or several Ring s, depending on the storage blocks the T1 table is stored. The number of blocks depends on the storage strategy. Each Ring will store several groups of sums, the number of group depends how many duplicate rows are in this Ring . T1 ( id , class , age ) + ------+-------+------+ | id | class | age | + ------+-------+------+ | 1 | one | 23 | | 2 | one | 20 | | 3 | one | 22 | | 4 | two | 20 | | 5 | two | 19 | | 6 | three | 18 | | 7 | three | 20 | | 8 | three | 21 | | 9 | three | 24 | | 10 | three | 19 | + ------+-------+------+ select class , sum ( age ) from T1 group by class ; For example, if two Ring s were generated, the first Ring holds the group sums of the first 4 rows, which will be like: | one | 23 + 20 + 22 | | two | 20 | The second Ring holds the group sums of the last 6 rows, which will be like: | two | 19 | | three | 18 + 20 + 21 + 24 + 19 | Then the Add method of Ring will be called to merge two groups together, and at last the Eval method will return the overall result to user. | one | 23 + 20 + 22 | | two | 20 + 19 | | three | 18 + 20 + 21 + 24 + 19 | 2. Query with joining multiple tables. In the multiple tables join scenario, we have two tables Tc and Ts . The query looks like the following. Tc ( id , class ) + ------+-------+ | id | class | + ------+-------+ | 1 | one | | 2 | one | | 3 | one | | 4 | two | | 5 | two | | 6 | three | | 7 | three | | 8 | three | | 9 | three | | 10 | three | + ------+-------+ Ts ( id , age ) + ------+------+ | id | age | + ------+------+ | 1 | 23 | | 2 | 20 | | 3 | 22 | | 4 | 20 | | 5 | 19 | | 6 | 18 | | 7 | 20 | | 8 | 24 | | 9 | 24 | | 10 | 19 | + ------+------+ select class , sum ( age ) from Tc join Ts on Tc . id = Ts . id group by class ; When we run this query, it will firstly generate Ring s for the Ts table, as we are performing aggeration over age column. It might generate also one or several Ring s, same as the single table. For simplyfing, we imagine only one Ring is created for each table. The Ring-Ts will start to count sums for the group of id , as all id s are different, so it will maintain the same. Then a hashtable will be created for performing join operation. The Ring-Tc is created in the same time as join is performed. This Ring-Tc will count the appearing frequency f of id. Then the Mul method of Ring-Ts is called, to calculate the sum calculated from the Ring-Ts and frequency from Ring-Tc . sum[i] = sum[i] * f[i] Now we get values of [class, sum(age)] , then performing a group by with class will give us the final result. The secret of factorisation From the above example, you can see that the Ring performs some pre calculations and only the result(like sum ) is stored in its structure. When performing operations like join , only simple Add or Multiplication is needed to get the result, which is called a push down calculation in factorisation . With the help of this push down, we no longer need to deal with costly Cartesian product. As the joined table number increases, the factorisation allow us to take linear cost performing that, instead of exponential increase. Develop an var() function In this tutorial, we walk you through the implementation of var (get the standard overall variance value) aggregate function as an example. Step 1: register function MatrixOne doesn't distinguish between operators and functions. In our code repository, the file pkg/sql/viewexec/transformer/types.go register aggregate functions as operators and we assign each operator a distinct integer number. To add a new function var() , add a new const Variance in the const declaration and var in the name declaration. const ( Sum = iota Avg Max Min Count StarCount ApproxCountDistinct Variance ) var TransformerNames = [ ... ] string { Sum : \"sum\" , Avg : \"avg\" , Max : \"max\" , Min : \"min\" , Count : \"count\" , StarCount : \"starcount\" , ApproxCountDistinct : \"approx_count_distinct\" , Variance : \"var\" , } Step2: implement the Ring interface 1. Define Ring structure Create `variance.go` under `pkg/container/ring`, and define a structure of `VarRing`. As we calculate the overall variance, we need to calculate: * The numeric Sums and the null value numbers of each group, to calculate the average. * Values of each group, to calculate the variance. // VarRing is the ring structure to compute the Overall variance type VarRing struct { // Typ is vector's value type Typ types . Type // attributes for computing the variance Data [] byte // store all the Sums' bytes Sums [] float64 // sums of each group, its memory address is same to Dates Values [][] float64 // values of each group NullCounts [] int64 // group to record number of the null value } 2. Implement the functions of Ring interface You can checkout the full implmetation at variance.go . func ( v * VarRing ) Grow ( m * mheap . Mheap ) error { n := len ( v . Sums ) if n == 0 { // The first time memory is allocated, // more space is allocated to avoid the performance loss caused by multiple allocations. data , err := mheap . Alloc ( m , 64 ) if err != nil { return err } v . Datas = data v . Sums = encoding . DecodeFloat64Slice ( data ) v . NullCounts = make ([] int64 , 0 , 8 ) v . Values = make ([][] float64 , 0 , 8 ) } else if n + 1 >= cap ( v . Sums ) { v . Datas = v . Datas [: n * 8 ] data , err := mheap . Grow ( m , v . Datas , int64 ( n + 1 ) * 8 ) if err != nil { return err } mheap . Free ( m , v . Datas ) v . Datas = data v . Sums = encoding . DecodeFloat64Slice ( data ) } v . Sums = v . Sums [: n + 1 ] v . Sums [ n ] = 0 v . NullCounts = append ( v . NullCounts , 0 ) v . Values = append ( v . Values , make ([] float64 , 0 , 16 )) return nil } // Add merge ring2 group Y into ring1's group X func ( v * VarRing ) Add ( a interface {}, x , y int64 ) { v2 := a .( * VarRing ) v . Sums [ x ] += v2 . Sums [ y ] v . NullCounts [ x ] += v2 . NullCounts [ y ] v . Values [ x ] = append ( v . Values [ x ], v2 . Values [ y ] ... ) } func ( v * VarRing ) Mul ( a interface {}, x , y , z int64 ) { v2 := a .( * VarRing ) { v . Sums [ x ] += v2 . Sums [ y ] * float64 ( z ) v . NullCounts [ x ] += v2 . NullCounts [ y ] * z for k := z ; k > 0 ; k -- { v . Values [ x ] = append ( v . Values [ x ], v2 . Values [ y ] ... ) } } } func ( v * VarRing ) Eval ( zs [] int64 ) * vector . Vector { defer func () { v . Values = nil v . Sums = nil v . NullCounts = nil v . Data = nil }() nsp := new ( nulls . Nulls ) for i , z := range zs { if n := z - v . NullCounts [ i ]; n == 0 { nulls . Add ( nsp , uint64 ( i )) } else { v . Sums [ i ] /= float64 ( n ) var variance float64 = 0 avg := v . Sums [ i ] for _ , value := range v . Values [ i ] { variance += math . Pow ( value - avg , 2.0 ) / float64 ( n ) } v . Sums [ i ] = variance } } return & vector . Vector { Nsp : nsp , Data : v . Data , Col : v . Sums , Or : false , Typ : types . Type { Oid : types . T_float64 , Size : 8 }, } } 3. Implement encoding and decoding for VarRing In the pkg/sql/protocol/protocol.go file, implement the code for serialization and deserialization of VarRing . Serialization function Deserialization function EncodeRing DecodeRing DecodeRingWithProcess Serialization: case * variance . VarRing : buf . WriteByte ( VarianceRing ) // NullCounts n := len ( v . NullCounts ) buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeUint32 ( uint32 ( n ))) if n > 0 { buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeInt64Slice ( v . NullCounts )) } // Values for k := 0 ; k < n ; k ++ { valueBytes := encoding . EncodeFloat64Slice ( v . Values [ k ]) length := len ( valueBytes ) buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeUint32 ( uint32 ( length ))) if length > 0 { buf . Write ( valueBytes ) } } // Sums da := encoding . EncodeFloat64Slice ( v . Sums ) n = len ( da ) buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeUint32 ( uint32 ( n ))) if n > 0 { buf . Write ( da ) } // Typ buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeType ( v . Typ )) return nil Deserialization: case VarianceRing : r := new ( variance . VarRing ) data = data [ 1 :] // decode NullCounts n := encoding . DecodeUint32 ( data [: 4 ]) data = data [ 4 :] if n > 0 { r . NullCounts = make ([] int64 , n ) copy ( r . NullCounts , encoding . DecodeInt64Slice ( data [: n * 8 ])) data = data [ n * 8 :] } // decode Values r . Values = make ([][] float64 , n ) var k uint32 = 0 for k = 0 ; k < n ; k ++ { length := encoding . DecodeUint32 ( data ) data = data [ 4 :] if length > 0 { r . Values [ k ] = encoding . DecodeFloat64Slice ( data [: length ]) data = data [ length :] } } // Sums n = encoding . DecodeUint32 ( data [: 4 ]) data = data [ 4 :] if n > 0 { r . Datas = data [: n ] data = data [ n :] } r . Sums = encoding . DecodeFloat64Slice ( r . Datas ) // Typ typ := encoding . DecodeType ( data [: encoding . TypeSize ]) data = data [ encoding . TypeSize :] r . Typ = typ // return return r , data , nil Here we go. Now we can fire up MatrixOne and try with our var() function. Compile and run MatrixOne Once the aggregation function is ready, we could compile and run MatrixOne to see the function behavior. Step1: Run make config and make build to compile the MatrixOne project and build binary file. make config make build Info make config generates a new configuration file, in this tutorial, you only need to run it once. If you modify some code and want to recompile, you only have to run make build . Step2: Run ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml to launch MatrixOne, the MatrixOne server will start to listen for client connecting. ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml Info The logger print level of system_vars_config.toml is set to default as DEBUG , which will print a lot of information for you. If you only care about what your function will print, you can modify the system_vars_config.toml and set cubeLogLevel and level to ERROR level. cubeLogLevel = \"error\" level = \"error\" Info Sometimes a port is in use error at port 50000 will occur. You could checkout what process in occupying port 50000 by lsof -i:50000 . This command helps you to get the PIDNAME of this process, then you can kill the process by kill -9 PIDNAME . Step3: Connect to MatrixOne server with a MySQL client. Use the built-in test account for example: user: dump password: 111 $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -udump -p Enter password: Step4: Test your function behavior with some data. Below is an example. You can check if you get the right mathematical variance result. You can also try an inner join and check the result, if the result is correct, the factorisation is valid. mysql > select * from variance ; + ------+------+ | a | b | + ------+------+ | 1 | 4 | | 10 | 3 | | 19 | 12 | | 239 | 114 | | 49 | 149 | | 10 | 159 | | 1 | 3 | | 34 | 35 | + ------+------+ 8 rows in set ( 0 . 04 sec ) mysql > select * from variance2 ; + ------+------+ | a | b | + ------+------+ | 14 | 3514 | | 10 | 3514 | | 1 | 61 | + ------+------+ 3 rows in set ( 0 . 02 sec ) mysql > select var ( variance . a ), var ( variance . b ) from variance ; + -----------------+-----------------+ | var ( variance . a ) | var ( variance . b ) | + -----------------+-----------------+ | 5596 . 2344 | 4150 . 1094 | + -----------------+-----------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 06 sec ) mysql > select variance . a , var ( variance . b ) from variance inner join variance2 on variance . a = variance2 . a group by variance . a ; + ------------+-----------------+ | variance . a | var ( variance . b ) | + ------------+-----------------+ | 10 | 6084 . 0000 | | 1 | 0 . 2500 | + ------------+-----------------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 04 sec ) Bingo! Info Except for var() , MatrixOne has already some neat examples for aggregate functions, such as sum() , count() , max() , min() and avg() . With some minor corresponding changes, the procedure is quite the same as other functions. \u200b Write unit Test for your function We recommend you to also write a unit test for the new function. Go has a built-in testing command called go test and a package testing which combine to give a minimal but complete testing experience. It automates execution of any function of the form. func TestXxx(*testing.T) To write a new test suite, create a file whose name ends _test.go that contains the TestXxx functions as described here. Put the file in the same package as the one being tested. The file will be excluded from regular package builds but will be included when the go test command is run. Step1: Create a file named variance_test.go under pkg/container/ring/variance/ directory. Import the testing framework and the reflect framework we are going to use for testing. package variance import ( \"fmt\" \"github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/pkg/container/types\" \"reflect\" \"testing\" ) // TestVariance just for verify varRing related process func TestVariance ( t * testing . T ) { } Step2: Implement the TestVariance function with some predefined values. // TestVariance just for verify varRing related process func TestVariance ( t * testing . T ) { // verify that if we can calculate // the variance of {1, 2, null, 0, 3, 4} and {2, 3, null, null, 4, 5} correctly // 1. make the test case v1 := NewVarRing ( types . Type { Oid : types . T_float64 }) v2 := v1 . Dup ().( * VarRing ) { // first 3 rows. v1 . Sums = [] float64 { 1 + 2 , 2 + 3 } v1 . Values = [][] float64 { { 1 , 2 }, // 1, 2, null { 2 , 3 }, // 2, 3, null } v1 . NullCounts = [] int64 { 1 , 1 } } { // last 3 rows. v2 . Sums = [] float64 { 0 + 3 + 4 , 4 + 5 } v2 . Values = [][] float64 { { 0 , 3 , 4 }, // 0, 3, 4 { 4 , 5 }, // null, 4, 5 } v2 . NullCounts = [] int64 { 0 , 1 } } v1 . Add ( v2 , 0 , 0 ) v1 . Add ( v2 , 1 , 1 ) result := v1 . Eval ([] int64 { 6 , 6 }) expected := [] float64 { 2.0 , 1.25 } if ! reflect . DeepEqual ( result . Col , expected ) { t . Errorf ( fmt . Sprintf ( \"TestVariance wrong, expected %v, but got %v\" , expected , result . Col )) } } Step3: Complete the unit test for Serialization and Deserialization in the function TestRing in the file pkg/sql/protocol/protocol_test.go . You can check the complete test code of VarRing there. & variance . VarRing { NullCounts : [] int64 { 1 , 2 , 3 }, Sums : [] float64 { 15 , 9 , 13.5 }, Values : [][] float64 { { 10 , 15 , 20 }, { 10.5 , 15.5 , 1 }, { 14 , 13 }, }, Typ : types . Type { Oid : types . T ( types . T_float64 ), Size : 8 }, }, case * variance . VarRing : oriRing := r .( * variance . VarRing ) // Sums if string ( ExpectRing . Dates ) != string ( encoding . EncodeFloat64Slice ( oriRing . Sums )) { t . Errorf ( \"Decode varRing Sums failed.\" ) return } // NullCounts for i , n := range oriRing . NullCounts { if ExpectRing . NullCounts [ i ] != n { t . Errorf ( \"Decode varRing NullCounts failed. \\nExpected/Got:\\n%v\\n%v\" , n , ExpectRing . NullCounts [ i ]) return } } // Values for i , v := range oriRing . Values { if ! reflect . DeepEqual ( ExpectRing . Values [ i ], v ) { t . Errorf ( \"Decode varRing Values failed. \\nExpected/Got:\\n%v\\n%v\" , v , ExpectRing . Values [ i ]) return } } Step4: Launch Test. Within the same directory as the test: go test This picks up any files matching packagename_test.go. If you are getting a PASS , you are passing the unit test. In MatrixOne, we have a bvt test framework which will run all the unit tests defined in the whole package, and each time your make a pull request to the code base, the test will automatically run. You code will be merged only if the bvt test pass.","title":"Develop an aggregate function"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_aggregate_functions/#develop-an-aggregate-function","text":"","title":"Develop an aggregate function"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_aggregate_functions/#prerequisite","text":"To develop an aggregate function for MatrixOne, you need a basic knowledge of Golang programming.

Then the Mul method of Ring-Ts is called, to calculate the sum calculated from the Ring-Ts and frequency from Ring-Tc . sum[i] = sum[i] * f[i] Now we get values of [class, sum(age)] , then performing a group by with class will give us the final result.","title":"How does Ring work with query:"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_aggregate_functions/#the-secret-of-factorisation","text":"From the above example, you can see that the Ring performs some pre calculations and only the result(like sum ) is stored in its structure.

Step 1: register function MatrixOne doesn't distinguish between operators and functions. In our code repository, the file pkg/sql/viewexec/transformer/types.go register aggregate functions as operators and we assign each operator a distinct integer number. To add a new function var() , add a new const Variance in the const declaration and var in the name declaration. const ( Sum = iota Avg Max Min Count StarCount ApproxCountDistinct Variance ) var TransformerNames = [ ... ] string { Sum : \"sum\" , Avg : \"avg\" , Max : \"max\" , Min : \"min\" , Count : \"count\" , StarCount : \"starcount\" , ApproxCountDistinct : \"approx_count_distinct\" , Variance : \"var\" , } Step2: implement the Ring interface 1. Define Ring structure Create `variance.go` under `pkg/container/ring`, and define a structure of `VarRing`. As we calculate the overall variance, we need to calculate: * The numeric Sums and the null value numbers of each group, to calculate the average. * Values of each group, to calculate the variance. // VarRing is the ring structure to compute the Overall variance type VarRing struct { // Typ is vector's value type Typ types .

You can go through this excellent Golang tutorial to get some Golang basic concepts. Preparation Before you start, please make sure that you have Go installed, cloned the MatrixOne code base. Please refer to Preparation and Contribute Code for more details. What is a built-in function? There are two types of functions in a database, built-in functions are functions that are shipped with the database, in contrast, user-defined functions is customized by the users. Built-in functions can be categorized according to the data types that they operate on i.e. strings, date and numeric built-in functions. An example of a built-in function is abs() , which when given a value calculates the absolute (non-negative) value of the number. Some functions, such as abs() are used to perform calculations, others such as getdate() are used to obtain a system value, such as the current data, or others, like left() , are used to manipulate textual data. Usually the built-in functions are categorized into major categories: Conversion Functions Logical Functions Math Functions String Functions Date Functions Develop an abs() function: In this tutorial, we use the function ABS (get the absolute value) as an example. Step 1: register function MatrixOne doesn't distinguish between operators and functions. In our code repository, the file pkg/builtin/types.go register builtin functions as operators and we assign each operator a distinct integer number. To add a new function abs() , add a new const Abs in the const declaration. const ( Length = iota + overload . NE + 1 Year Round Floor Abs ) In the directory pkg/builtin/unary , create a new go file abs.go . Info The functions under unary directory take only one value as input. The functions under binary directory take only two values as input. Other forms of functions are put under multi directory. This abs.go file has the following functionalities: 1. function name registration 2. declare all the different parameter types this function accepts, and the different return type when given different parameter types. 3. the stringification method for this function. 4. preparation for function calling and function calling. package unary func init () { } In Golang, init function will be called when a package is initialized. We wrap all ABS() 's functionality inside this init function so we don't need to call it explicitly. 1. function name registration func init () { extend . FunctionRegistry [ \"abs\" ] = builtin . Abs // register function name } In MatrixOne, all letters in a function name will be lowercased during the parsing process, so register function names using only lowercase letters otherwise the function won't be recognized. 2. declare function parameter types and return types. The function abs accepts all numeric types as its parameter(uint8, int8, float32...), we can return a 64bit value covering all different parameter types, or, to optimize the performance of our function, we can return different types with respect to the parameter type. Outside the init function, declare these variables for each pair of parameter type and return type. var argAndRets = [] argsAndRet { {[] types . T { types . T_uint8 }, types . T_uint8 }, {[] types . T { types . T_uint16 }, types . T_uint16 }, {[] types . T { types . T_uint32 }, types . T_uint32 }, {[] types . T { types . T_uint64 }, types . T_uint64 }, {[] types . T { types . T_int8 }, types .

Type ) ( * vector . Vector , error ) since we need a float32 vector here, its size should be 4 * len(origVecCol), 4 bytes for each float32. 2.encoding.DecodeFloat32Slice: this is just type casting. 3.Vector.Nsp: MatrixOne uses bitmaps to store the NULL values in a column, Vector.Nsp is a wrap up struct for this bitmap. Since the result vector has the same type as the original vector, we could use the original vector to store our result when we don't need our original vector anymore in our execution plan(i.e., the reference count of the original vector is 0 or 1).

AbsFloat64 ( origVecCol , results )) return resultVector , nil }, }, } } Step 2: Implement Abs function In MatrixOne, We put all of our builtin function definition code in the pkg/vectorize/ directory, to implement abs functions, first we need to create a subdirectory abs in this vectorize directory. In this fresh abs directory, create a file abs.go , the place where our abs function implementation code goes. For certain cpu architectures, we could utilize the cpu's intrinsic SIMD instruction to compute the absolute value and hence boost our function's performance, to differentiate function implementations for different cpu architectures, we declare our pure go version of abs function this way: package abs var ( absFloat32 func ([] float32 , [] float32 ) [] float32 absFloat64 func ([] float64 , [] float64 ) [] float64 ) func init () { absFloat32 = absFloat32Pure absFloat64 = absFloat64Pure } func AbsFloat32 ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { return absFloat32 ( xs , rs ) } func absFloat32Pure ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { } func AbsFloat64 ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { return absFloat64 ( xs , rs ) } func absFloat64Pure ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { } Inside the absFloat32Pure and absFloat64Pure, we implement our golang version of abs function for float32 and float64 type. The other data types (int8, int16, int32, int64) are more or less the same. func absFloat32Pure ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { for i := range xs { if xs [ i ] < 0 { rs [ i ] = - xs [ i ] } else { rs [ i ] = xs [ i ] } } return rs } func absFloat64Pure ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { for i := range xs { if xs [ i ] < 0 { rs [ i ] = - xs [ i ] } else { rs [ i ] = xs [ i ] } } return rs } Here we go. Now we can fire up MatrixOne and take our abs function for a little spin. Compile and run MatrixOne Once the function is ready, we could compile and run MatrixOne to see the function behavior. Step1: Run make config and make build to compile the MatrixOne project and build binary file. make config make build Info make config generates a new configuration file, in this tutorial, you only need to run it once. If you modify some code and want to recompile, you only have to run make build . Step2: Run ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml to launch MatrixOne, the MatrixOne server will start to listen for client connecting. ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml Info The logger print level of system_vars_config.toml is set to default as DEBUG , which will print a lot of information for you. If you only care about what your built-in function will print, you can modify the system_vars_config.toml and set cubeLogLevel and level to ERROR level. cubeLogLevel = \"error\" level = \"error\" Info Sometimes a port is in use error at port 50000 will occur. You could checkout what process in occupying port 50000 by lsof -i:50000 . This command helps you to get the PIDNAME of this process, then you can kill the process by kill -9 PIDNAME . Step3: Connect to MatrixOne server with a MySQL client. Use the built-in test account for example: user: dump password: 111 $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -udump -p Enter password: Step4: Test your function behavior with some data. Below is an example. mysql > create table abs_test_table ( a float , b double ); Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0 . 44 sec ) mysql > insert into abs_test_table values ( 12 . 34 , - 43 . 21 ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 08 sec ) mysql > insert into abs_test_table values ( - 12 . 34 , 43 . 21 ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 02 sec ) mysql > insert into abs_test_table values ( 2 . 718 , - 3 . 14 ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 02 sec ) mysql > select a , b , abs ( a ), abs ( b ) from abs_test_table ; + ----------+----------+---------+---------+ | a | b | abs ( a ) | abs ( b ) | + ----------+----------+---------+---------+ | 12 . 3400 | - 43 . 2100 | 12 . 3400 | 43 . 2100 | | - 12 . 3400 | 43 . 2100 | 12 . 3400 | 43 . 2100 | | 2 . 7180 | - 3 . 1400 | 2 . 7180 | 3 . 1400 | + ----------+----------+---------+---------+ 3 rows in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) Bingo! Info Except for abs() , MatrixOne has already some neat examples for built-in functions, such as floor() , round() , year() . With some minor corresponding changes, the procedure is quite the same as other functions. \u200b Write a unit Test for your function We recommend you to also write a unit test for the new function. Go has a built-in testing command called go test and a package testing which combine to give a minimal but complete testing experience. It automates execution of any function of the form. func TestXxx(*testing.T) To write a new test suite, create a file whose name ends _test.go that contains the TestXxx functions as described here. Put the file in the same package as the one being tested. The file will be excluded from regular package builds but will be included when the go test command is run. Step1: Create a file named abs_test.go under vectorize/abs/ directory. Import the testing framework and the testify framework we are going to use for testing mathematical equal . package abs import ( \"testing\" \"github.com/stretchr/testify/require\" ) function TestAbsFloat32(t *testing.T) { } function TestAbsFloat64(t *testing.T) { } Step2: Implement the TestXxx functions with some predefined values. func TestAbsFloat32(t *testing.T) { //Test values nums := []float32{1.5, -1.5, 2.5, -2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, -1.2, -12.3, -123.4, -1234.5, -12345.6} //Predefined Correct Values absNums := []float32{1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6} //Init a new variable newNums := make([]float32, len(nums)) //Run abs function newNums = absFloat32(nums, newNums) for i, _ := range newNums { require.Equal(t, absNums[i], newNums[i]) } } func TestAbsFloat64(t *testing.T) { //Test values nums := []float64{1.5, -1.5, 2.5, -2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, -1.2, -12.3, -123.4, -1234.5, -12345.6} //Predefined Correct Values absNums := []float64{1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6} //Init a new variable newNums := make([]float64, len(nums)) //Run abs function newNums = absFloat64(nums, newNums) for i, _ := range newNums { require.Equal(t, absNums[i], newNums[i]) } } Step3: Launch Test. Within the same directory as the test: go test This picks up any files matching packagename_test.go. If you are getting a PASS , you are passing the unit test. In MatrixOne, we have a bvt test framework which will run all the unit tests defined in the whole package, and each time your code is merged in the code base, the test will automatically run.","title":"Develop a built-in function"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_builtin_functions/#develop-a-built-in-function","text":"","title":"Develop a built-in function"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_builtin_functions/#prerequisite","text":"To develop a build-in function for MatrixOne, you need a basic knowledge of Golang programming.

Built-in functions can be categorized according to the data types that they operate on i.e. strings, date and numeric built-in functions. An example of a built-in function is abs() , which when given a value calculates the absolute (non-negative) value of the number. Some functions, such as abs() are used to perform calculations, others such as getdate() are used to obtain a system value, such as the current data, or others, like left() , are used to manipulate textual data.

The functions under binary directory take only two values as input. Other forms of functions are put under multi directory. This abs.go file has the following functionalities: 1. function name registration 2. declare all the different parameter types this function accepts, and the different return type when given different parameter types. 3. the stringification method for this function. 4. preparation for function calling and function calling. package unary func init () { } In Golang, init function will be called when a package is initialized.

Abs // register function name } In MatrixOne, all letters in a function name will be lowercased during the parsing process, so register function names using only lowercase letters otherwise the function won't be recognized. 2. declare function parameter types and return types. The function abs accepts all numeric types as its parameter(uint8, int8, float32...), we can return a 64bit value covering all different parameter types, or, to optimize the performance of our function, we can return different types with respect to the parameter type. Outside the init function, declare these variables for each pair of parameter type and return type. var argAndRets = [] argsAndRet { {[] types . T { types . T_uint8 }, types . T_uint8 }, {[] types .

Since the result vector has the same type as the original vector, we could use the original vector to store our result when we don't need our original vector anymore in our execution plan(i.e., the reference count of the original vector is 0 or 1).

AbsFloat64 ( origVecCol , results )) return resultVector , nil }, }, } } Step 2: Implement Abs function In MatrixOne, We put all of our builtin function definition code in the pkg/vectorize/ directory, to implement abs functions, first we need to create a subdirectory abs in this vectorize directory. In this fresh abs directory, create a file abs.go , the place where our abs function implementation code goes. For certain cpu architectures, we could utilize the cpu's intrinsic SIMD instruction to compute the absolute value and hence boost our function's performance, to differentiate function implementations for different cpu architectures, we declare our pure go version of abs function this way: package abs var ( absFloat32 func ([] float32 , [] float32 ) [] float32 absFloat64 func ([] float64 , [] float64 ) [] float64 ) func init () { absFloat32 = absFloat32Pure absFloat64 = absFloat64Pure } func AbsFloat32 ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { return absFloat32 ( xs , rs ) } func absFloat32Pure ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { } func AbsFloat64 ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { return absFloat64 ( xs , rs ) } func absFloat64Pure ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { } Inside the absFloat32Pure and absFloat64Pure, we implement our golang version of abs function for float32 and float64 type. The other data types (int8, int16, int32, int64) are more or less the same. func absFloat32Pure ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { for i := range xs { if xs [ i ] < 0 { rs [ i ] = - xs [ i ] } else { rs [ i ] = xs [ i ] } } return rs } func absFloat64Pure ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { for i := range xs { if xs [ i ] < 0 { rs [ i ] = - xs [ i ] } else { rs [ i ] = xs [ i ] } } return rs } Here we go. Now we can fire up MatrixOne and take our abs function for a little spin.","title":"Develop an abs() function:"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_builtin_functions/#compile-and-run-matrixone","text":"Once the function is ready, we could compile and run MatrixOne to see the function behavior.

Connect to MatrixOne server"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Get-Started/install-distributed-matrixone/","text":"Install distributed MatrixOne MatrixOne supports distributed deloyment. At least 3 stores (same as Nodes) are required for the distributed setting. Two Types of Stores There are two types of stores in a MatrixOne cluster: prophet stores and pure storage stores. The first three stores are prophet stores. The others are pure storage stores. For example, if there're three stores in the cluster, all the stores are prophet stores. If there're five nodes in the cluster, three are prophet stores, two are pure storage stores. Installation This tutorial is an example of 5 stores installation. Step1 : Prepare 3 servers as prophet stores (recommended specification: x86 CPU with 16 cores and 64GB memory, with CentOS 7+ OS). Each store must install a MatrixOne as standalone version. Installation steps are the same as the standalone . Step2 : Set up store1, which is also called the Prophet Genesis Store . Set id of the Prophet Genesis Store: nodeID = 1 Set addr-raft and addr-client to receive Raft protocol and Shard Proxy messages from other MatrixCube stores: addr-raft = \"your_ip_address:10000\" addr-client = \"your_ip_address:20000\" Set the size limit of a Shard : shard-capacity-bytes = \"96MB\" Set rpc-addr to receive heartbeats from the whole cluster: rpc-addr = \"your_ip_address:30000\" Set join , client-urls and peer-urls to group into a Etcd-server cluster. As the Prophet Genesis Store is the first store, the join parameter can remain empty: join = \"\" client-urls = \"your_ip_address:40000\" peer-urls = \"your_ip_address:50000\" 6. Set storage-node to TRUE, as the prophet store will hold the cluster metadata: storage-node = true 7. Set max-replicas number to the replica numbers that you want, it can only be 2*N+1 numbers: max-replicas = 3 Step3 : Set up store2 and store3 as prophet stores. Repeat the same procedure of step1 and step2 for each store. The only two differences are setting a unique nodeID and a join ip address. nodeID = 2 or 3; join = \"ip_address_of_store1\" Step4 : Set up the other two stores as pure storage store. Repeat the same procedure of step1 and step2 for each store. There are three more parameters to be set: * Set a unique number for nodeID. * Set storage-node to TRUE. * Fill the three empty string with the three client-urls of the three prophet node for the external-etcd parameter. nodeID = 4/5; storage-node = false; storage-node = [\"ip_address_of_prophet_store1\",\"ip_address_of_prophet_store2\",\"ip_address_of_prophet_store3\"] To learn more about our distribute system parameters, please refer to distributed settings .","title":"Install Distributed MatrixOne"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Get-Started/install-distributed-matrixone/#install-distributed-matrixone","text":"MatrixOne supports distributed deloyment.

This chapter will unfold the architecture and explain about the tech design. MatrixOne Architectural Features The current design of MatrixOne is a combination of NewSQL and MPP, and we call it an HTAP DBMS with OLAP enhancement. Simplicity is the most important design principle for both usage, deployment and maintenance. Despite being a distributed database, MatrixOne only provides a single binary for deployment, with each node running exactly the same single process. NewSQL As we all know, relational database has existed for more than 30 years with relational model , SQL and transaction processing , until recently NewSQL emerged. NewSQL refers to a distributed architecture, starting with Google Spanner, using Replicate State Machine as the core, to solve the scalability and high availability problems of traditional standalone relational databases. Replicate State Machine is the main method to implement fault-tolerant services. The state machine starts at a given initial state, and each input received is used by a state transition mechanism to generate a new state and corresponding output. In replicate state machines, the state machines of a set of servers compute copies of the same state and can continue to run even if a portion of the servers go down. In the context of replicate state machines, consistency protocols are proposed to ensure the consistency of replicate logs. Common consistency protocols include Paxos and Raft. In the architecturet of replicate state machine, OLTP capability is realized by mounting the Key Value storage engine, which is the main design of NewSQL. The biggest difference between MatrixOne's design and other NewSQL databases is that the former one can mount various storage engines. In the 0.2 version, the Key-Value storage engine is mounted to store Catalog and other metadata and a column storage engine is mounted to provide OLAP capability. In fact, any storage engine can be mounted including but not limited to row storage, graph, time series, dedicated NoSQL and other multimodal engines. Different storage engines can be adapted for different scenarios. We welcome community developers to contribute ideas and code to this part. MPP MPP(Massively Parallel Processing) is a computing architecture that is used to analyze large-scale data. In simple terms, MPP is to distribute tasks to multiple servers and nodes in parallel. After the computation is completed on each node, the results of each part are aggregated together to obtain the final result. This architecture was adopted by first-generation OLAP databases such as Teradata and Greenplum. MapReduce, the key component for Hadoop, also borrowed from the MPP architecture. However, between Hadoop and MPP OLAP databases, differences are obvious in the amount of data processed, SQL support, data processing types and efficiency. Hadoop is more like a data lake, which can store and process hundreds of PB data, define schema when reading, and store a large amount of unstructured and semi-structured data. However, SQL support, query performance and real-time streaming processing are not ideal. A database solution based on the MPP architecture is more like a relational database with substantially enhanced query capabilities, still with good SQL support and ACID transaction properties. The latest generation of open-source MPP compute engines includes: Clickhouse, Presto, Impala, SparkSQL, Apache Doris, etc. MatrixOne also provides great OLAP performance based on the MPP architecture. But differently from other projects, MPP compute engine in MatrixOne is based on Golang. Even compared to C++ computing engines, it can compete in performance. After acceleration through vectorization and factorization, it performs even better in scenarios such as non-primary key join, multi-table complex join and other aspects. MatrixOne's Designed Modules and Current Progress MatrixOne is divided into SQL Frontend , Computing Layer , Metadata Layer , Distributed Framework and Storage Layer . SQL Frontend The entry of the MatrixOne. Currently MatrixOne provides MySQL compatibility protocol and support part of MySQL dialact. SQL Frontend receives requests from MySQL clients and pass to next layer after parsing them. Learn more about MatrixOne MySQL Compatibility SQL Parser in Computing Layer After receiving a request from the SQL Frontend, SQL Parser parses it and transforms it into an abstract syntax tree(AST). MatrixOne doesn't use the popular open-source query parser, such as TiDB, Vitess parser, etc. In fact, TiDB parser was used in MatrixOne version 0.1, but we developed a new parser for version 0.2, mainly because: * MatrixOne intends to create a hyperconverged database where lots of custom syntax not necessarily consistent to MySQL. * Currently, MatrixOne enhances more OLAP capabilities, whereas the current open-source parser is basically designed for OLTP scenarios, and has high performance overhead for some OLAP scenarios, such as mass insertion. * MatrixOne also plans to offer multi-dialect protocol compatibility in the future, including PostgreSQL, Hive, ClickHouse and so on. Therefore, MatrixOne needs to own its own Query Parser, which can be customized arbitrarily, and provides the basis for multi-dialect syntactic compatibility. MPP SQL Execution in Computing Layer This part is the MPP compute engine established by Golang. MatrixOne compute engine accelerates SQL excutions by vectorization acceleration. The vectorization is achieved by leveraging hardware features. At present, only the adaptation and acceleration of AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets in Intel X86 architecture are realized. More hardware platform support for accleration can be an interesting subject for community participations. Another important design in compute engine is factorization, which breaks down the complex SQL join into an linear polynomial calculation, and significantly reduces the time consumed for complex join. Catalog as Metadata Layer It's the component that holds the overall metadata of the database, such as Table/Schema definitions. Currently, Catalog is still a temporary solution using Key-Value engine, and the subsequent Catalog will be migrated to a standard OLTP engine, providing further and more complete ACID capability to support the Catalog component. MatrixCube as Distributed Framework This component is a distributed infrastructure library that implements the NewSQL architecture and is currently a separate repository. It contains two parts of functionality, one is to provide the consensus protocol of the Replicate State Machine implementation, currently using Multi Raft mechanism and the other is to provide a replica scheduling mechanism based on Raft, which is called Prophet in the code. MatrixCube is a universal library that can interface with various storage engines, which is why we set it as a separate repository currently. Any third party developer can easily use it to implement distributed storage engines and databases with strong consistency. Another important functionality of MatrixCube is to provide distributed transaction capabilities, which is currently being designed and will soon be available for discussion by developers. Please refer to MatrixCube introduction for more details. Storage Engine In MatrixOne, storage engine is selectable, and thus you can specify an engine to determine which one will be used to store data when creating tables with DDL syntax. In the current version, only one engine is implemented: AOE Engine(which stood for \"Analytics Optimized Engine\", evolving from \"Append Only Engine\", which is a column storage engine with \"Append Only\" mode. An evolution of AOE is called TAE(Transactional Analytical Engine) , a column-based HTAP Engine that provides complete ACID capability and powerful OLAP capability, and it's currently under development. When completed, MatrixOne will have complete distribution HTAP ability. Please refer to AOE Technical Design for more details. Another TPE(Transaction Processing Engine) is under development.

NewSQL refers to a distributed architecture, starting with Google Spanner, using Replicate State Machine as the core, to solve the scalability and high availability problems of traditional standalone relational databases. Replicate State Machine is the main method to implement fault-tolerant services. The state machine starts at a given initial state, and each input received is used by a state transition mechanism to generate a new state and corresponding output. In replicate state machines, the state machines of a set of servers compute copies of the same state and can continue to run even if a portion of the servers go down. In the context of replicate state machines, consistency protocols are proposed to ensure the consistency of replicate logs. Common consistency protocols include Paxos and Raft. In the architecturet of replicate state machine, OLTP capability is realized by mounting the Key Value storage engine, which is the main design of NewSQL. The biggest difference between MatrixOne's design and other NewSQL databases is that the former one can mount various storage engines. In the 0.2 version, the Key-Value storage engine is mounted to store Catalog and other metadata and a column storage engine is mounted to provide OLAP capability. In fact, any storage engine can be mounted including but not limited to row storage, graph, time series, dedicated NoSQL and other multimodal engines. Different storage engines can be adapted for different scenarios. We welcome community developers to contribute ideas and code to this part.","title":"NewSQL"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/MatrixOne-Tech-Design/matrixone-techdesign/#mpp","text":"MPP(Massively Parallel Processing) is a computing architecture that is used to analyze large-scale data. In simple terms, MPP is to distribute tasks to multiple servers and nodes in parallel. After the computation is completed on each node, the results of each part are aggregated together to obtain the final result. This architecture was adopted by first-generation OLAP databases such as Teradata and Greenplum. MapReduce, the key component for Hadoop, also borrowed from the MPP architecture. However, between Hadoop and MPP OLAP databases, differences are obvious in the amount of data processed, SQL support, data processing types and efficiency. Hadoop is more like a data lake, which can store and process hundreds of PB data, define schema when reading, and store a large amount of unstructured and semi-structured data. However, SQL support, query performance and real-time streaming processing are not ideal. A database solution based on the MPP architecture is more like a relational database with substantially enhanced query capabilities, still with good SQL support and ACID transaction properties. The latest generation of open-source MPP compute engines includes: Clickhouse, Presto, Impala, SparkSQL, Apache Doris, etc. MatrixOne also provides great OLAP performance based on the MPP architecture. But differently from other projects, MPP compute engine in MatrixOne is based on Golang. Even compared to C++ computing engines, it can compete in performance. After acceleration through vectorization and factorization, it performs even better in scenarios such as non-primary key join, multi-table complex join and other aspects.","title":"MPP"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/MatrixOne-Tech-Design/matrixone-techdesign/#matrixones-designed-modules-and-current-progress","text":"MatrixOne is divided into SQL Frontend , Computing Layer , Metadata Layer , Distributed Framework and Storage Layer .","title":"MatrixOne's Designed Modules and Current Progress"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/MatrixOne-Tech-Design/matrixone-techdesign/#sql-frontend","text":"The entry of the MatrixOne.

MatrixOne doesn't use the popular open-source query parser, such as TiDB, Vitess parser, etc. In fact, TiDB parser was used in MatrixOne version 0.1, but we developed a new parser for version 0.2, mainly because: * MatrixOne intends to create a hyperconverged database where lots of custom syntax not necessarily consistent to MySQL. * Currently, MatrixOne enhances more OLAP capabilities, whereas the current open-source parser is basically designed for OLTP scenarios, and has high performance overhead for some OLAP scenarios, such as mass insertion. * MatrixOne also plans to offer multi-dialect protocol compatibility in the future, including PostgreSQL, Hive, ClickHouse and so on.

It is designed to facilitate distributed, stateful application building to allow developers only need to focus on the business logic on a single node. MatrixCube is currently built upon multi-raft to provide replicated state machine and will migrate to Paxos families to increase friendliness to scenarios spanning multiple data centers. Unlike many other distributed systems, MatrixCube is designed as part of the storage nodes. A matrixone distributed deployment doesn't not have dedicated scheduling nodes. MatrixCube cannot work as a standalone module. MatrixCube Architecture Key Concepts There are several key concepts for understanding how MatrixCube works. Store A MatrixCube distributed system consists of several physical computers, our data are stored across these physical computers. We call each computer inside this cluster a Store . Shard Our data in database are organized in tables logically. But for physical storage, the data are split into different partitions to store in order to get better scalability. Each partition is called a Shard . In our design, a new created table is initially a Shard . When the size of the table exceeds the Shard size limit, the Shard will split. Replica To provide reliable service, each Shard is stored not only once, it will have several copy stored in different Stores . We call each copy a Replica . A Shard can have multiple Replica , the data in each Replica are the same. Raft-group and Leader Since multiple Replicas are located in different Stores , once a Replica is updated, the other Replicas must be updated to keep data consistency. When a client makes query to no matter which Replica , it always gets the same result. We deploy Raft protocol to implement the concensus process. The Replicas of a particular Shard group into a Raft-group . In each Raft-group , a Leader is elected to be the representative of this group. All consistent read and write requests are handled only by the leader. Learn more about: How does a Leader get elected in Raft? Data Storage A DataStorage is an interface for implementing distributed storage service. It must be defined in prior to using MatrixCube. DataStorage needs to be implemented based on the characteristics of storage engine. Some common distributed storage service can be easily constructed based on DataStorage , such as Distributed Redis , Distributed Key-Value , Distributed File System etc. A default Key-Value based DataStorage is provided to meet the requirements of most scenarios. Prophet Prophet is a scheduling module. It takes charge of Auto-Rebalance , which keeps the system storage level and read/write throughput level balanced across Stores . The inital 3 Stores of a MatrixCube cluster are all Prophet Nodes . Learn more about How does Prophet handle the scheduling? Raftstore Raftstore is the core component of MatrixCube, it implements the most important features of MatrixCube: Metadata storage: including the metadata of Store , Shard , Raft-log . Multi-Raft management: the relationship between Store , Shard , Replica , Raft-Group , the communication between multiple Raft-Group s, Leader election and re-election. Global Routing: a global routing table will be constructed with the Event Notify mechanism of Prophet . The read/write routing will be based on this routing table. Shard Proxy: a proxy for read/write request for Shard . With the proxy, the detailed implementation of Multi-Raft is senseless and all Store s are equal for users. User can make request to any Store , all requests will be routed to the right Store by Shard Proxy . Learn more about How do the Shard Proxy and Global Routing work? Key Features Strong Consistency MatrixCube provides a strong consistency. It is guaranteed that after any successful data write, the reading afterwards will get the latest value, no matter from which store. Fault Tolerance The distributed storage service implemented by MatrixCube is a fault tolerant and high available service. When a Shard has 2*N+1 Replicas , the system can still work until N+1 Replicas fail. For example, a cluster with 3 Stores can survive with 1 Store failure; a cluster with 5 Stores can survive with 2 Stores failure. Shard Splitting There is a certain limit to a Shard size. Whenever a Shard exceeds its storage limit, MatrixCube splits a Shard into two Shards and keep each Shard with the same storage level. You can checkout a more detailed descripition about this process with How does the Shard Splitting work? . Auto-Rebalance A distributed system should leverage all the computation power and storage of all nodes. For a MatrixCube cluster, when there is an increase or decrease of Stores , an Auto-Rebalance will occur, which moves data across Stores to reach balance for each single Store . Learn more about: How does the Auto-Rebalance work? . Scale-out With shard splitting and auto-rebalance, a MatrixCube distributed system is capable of scaling out. The cluster storage and throughput capability are proportional to the number of Stores . User-defined storage engine MatrixCube has no limit to standalone data storage engine. Any storage engine implementing DataStorage interface defined by MatrixCube could construct a MatrixCube-based distributed system. By default, MatrixCube provides a Pebble -based Key-Value storage engine. ( Pebble is a Go version of RocksDB ). User-defined Read/Write As a general distributed framework, different distributed storage system could be build based on MatrixCube. User can also customize their read/write commands. As long as it works in a standalone version, MatrixCube can help you upgrading it to a distributed version.","title":"MatrixCube Introduction"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/matrixcube/matrixcube-introduction/#matrixcube-introduction","text":"MatrixCube is a fundamental library for building distributed systems, which offers guarantees about reliability, consistency, and scalability.
