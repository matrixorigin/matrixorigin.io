# Connecting to MatrixOne with Database Client Tool

MatrixOne now supports the following Database client tools:

- MySQL Client
- Navicat
- DBeaver

## Before you start

Make sure you have already [installed and launched MatrixOne](../../Get-Started/install-standalone-matrixone.md).

## Connect to the MatrixOne Server through MySQL Client

1. Download and install [MySQL Client](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

2. Connect to the MatrixOne server.

    You can use the MySQL command-line client to connect to MatrixOne server:

    ```
    mysql -h IP -P PORT -uUsername -p
    ```

    The connection string is the same format as MySQL accepts. You need to provide a user name and a password.

    Use the built-in test account for example:

    - user: root
    - password: 111

    ```
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -uroot -p
    Enter password:
    ```

    !!! info
        The login account in the above code snippet is the initial account; please change the initial password after logging in to MatrixOne; see [Password Management](../../Security/password-mgmt.md).

    The successful result is as below:

    ```
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g. Your MySQL connection id is 1031
    Server version: 8.0.30-MatrixOne-v1.0.0-rc1 MatrixOne
