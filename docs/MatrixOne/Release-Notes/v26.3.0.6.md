# **MatrixOne v26.3.0.6 Release Notes**

Release Date: January 28, 2025
MatrixOne Version: v26.3.0.6

MatrixOne 3.0.6 introduces improvements and bug fixes that enhance usability. Below are the major updates.

### Key Improvements

- Bloom filter & multi‑CN: Support Bloom filters without regular filters and broadcast Bloom filters across CNs to improve distributed query performance.
- Backup & export: Add a file index for backups and fix table data export issues to make backup/restore and export more reliable.
- Vector features: Enable simsimd (MO_CL_SIMSIMD=1), support vector indexes for prepared statements, and refine vector test cases for better performance and stability.
- Optimizer & execution: Improve UNION result stability, refine filter push‑down and hint handling (including CTE and type matching), and correct NDV estimation for modulo operations.
- GC & storage: Optimize GC behavior, fix tmp‑fs GC logging nil‑entry handling, and scope CN segment maps by transaction and table to avoid clone‑related delete skips.

### Key Bug Fixes

- Fix a hang that could occur after packet loss during data loading.
- Fix inconsistent caching in the auto‑increment service, stabilize nested SQL/auto‑increment retry paths, and remove noisy auto‑increment logs.
- Fix multi‑CN scan statistics consistency, a window function compatibility issue, and cap out of range crashes.
- Correct default MARCH for x86_64 (was incorrectly set to haswell) to avoid compatibility and performance issues.
