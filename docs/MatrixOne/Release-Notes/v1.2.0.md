## What's New in v1.2.0?

### Snapshot Backup and Recovery(Beta)

Database snapshot is an efficient technology for database backup and recovery, providing a read-only static copy of the database at a specific point in time. It assists database administrators and developers in performing various operations while ensuring the consistency and integrity of the data.  

- Support for tenant-level snapshot backup and recovery using the mo_br tool and sql statement.  
- Support for uninterrupted database operation during the snapshot creation process.  
- Support for rapidly restoring data to the state at the time of backup, effectively reducing the Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

### Incremental Physical Backup(Enterprise Edition)

On the basis of full backup in the mo_backup tool,we support for incremental backup feature , which only backs up the newly changed data, significantly reducing the backup time and storage space requirements.

### CTAS

Support for CTAS (Create Table As Select).CTAS is an SQL statement used to quickly create a new table based on existing data. It combines the functionality of table creation with a select query, providing an efficient way to create snapshots of tables, perform data transformations, or build data models for reporting and analysis.

### BITMAP Fast Deduplication

BITMAP is a set of built-in functions for handling bitmaps, mainly used for rapid deduplication of large volumes of data.

- Support for rapid data deduplication using BITMAP functions.
- Support for determining the bucket number with the BITMAP_BUCKET_NUMBER() function.
- Support for returning the relative bit position within a bucket using the BITMAP_BIT_POSITION() function.
- Support for constructing bitmaps with the BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG() function.

### Vector Index

- Support for using vector indexing to accelerate KNN queries.

## Other New Features

### SQL Statements

- Support for insert ignore
- Support for create table ... like
- Support for create index ... using ivfflat
- Support for alter table ... alter reindex
- Support for load data ... character set
- Support for creat snapshot
- Support for show snapshots
- Support for restore account
- Support for drop snapshot
- Optimized alter publication
- Optimized show publications

### Date Type

- Support for bit

### Indexs and Constraints

- Support for Vector Index

### Built-in Functions and Operators

- Added SYSDATE date function.
- Added TO_BASE64 and FROM_BASE64 encoding and decoding functions.
- Added MD5 and SHA1/SHA encryption functions.
- Added SUBVECTOR function for extracting subvectors.
- Added SERIAL_EXTRACT function for extracting sub-elements.
- Added CLUSTER_CENTERS cluster centers function.
- Support operations between vector and scalar.

### System Parameters

- Added keep_user_target_list_in_result.
- Added foreign_key_checks.

### MySQL Compatibility

- Refactored the CSV reader and CSV splitting to maintain compatibility with MySQL.

## Known Issues

- Vector Index works only in l2_distance.
- Only support tenant-level snapshot backup and recovery.
- Snapshot recovery requires rewriting the entire data, which consumes a lot of CPU and memory resources.
- Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues occur with large data volumes Occasionally.
- Under high concurrency load, the system occasionally becomes unresponsive.
