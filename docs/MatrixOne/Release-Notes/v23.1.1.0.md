# **MatrixOne v23.1.1.0 Release Notes**

We are thrilled to announce the release of MatrixOne v23.1.1.0 on 2023/12/29!

MatrixOne is a hyper-converged cloud-native database. It is designed to provide a cloud-native, high-performance, highly scalable, MySQL-compatible HTAP database. MatrixOne enables users to handle mixed workloads such as transactions, analytics, time-series, and streaming processing through a one-stop data processing solution.

## What's New in v1.1.0?

### Vector Data Type

These features enable users to quickly build AI applications, such as RAG applications based on large language models (LLMs). Unlike specialized vector databases, MatrixOne is a general database highly compatible with MySQL, enabling users to get started quickly without additional learning barriers. It also integrates structured and vector data processing for building AI applications.

- Implemented vecf32 (float32) and vecf64 (float64) type.
- Support for basic binary operators: +,-,*,/.
- Support for comparison operators: =, !=, >, >=, <, <=.
- Support for unary functions: sqrt,abs,cast.
- Support for vector functions: summation,l1_norm,l2_norm,vector_dims,inner_product,cosine_similarity.
- Support for aggregate function: count.

### Time Series

- Support for streaming loading with LOAD INTO INLINE, surpassing INSERT INTO in performance.
- Support for time-series tables with timestamps as primary keys, and support for any dimension/metric columns.
- Support sliding window for downsampling queries over different time periods.
- Support for interpolation with various interpolation methods.

### Kafka Connector(beta)

- Support for creating dynamic and append-only table with CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE.
- Support for configuring external data sources with CREATE SOURCE.
- Support for Kafka topic integration with JSON or protobuf format.

### User Defined Functions(beta)

- Support for creating Python-based UDF

## Other New Features

### DDL Statements

- Support for insert on duplicate key ignore.
- Support for create or replace view.
- Support for alter sequence.
- Support for Key, hash partition pruning capabilities (beta).
- Support for List/List column, Range/Range Columns partition storage capabilities (beta).

### Indexes and Constraints

- Full support of secondary indexes for dynamic query acceleration.

### Built-in Functions

- Added SAMPLE sampling function.
- Added CONVERT_TZ time zone conversion function.
- Added SHA2 encryption function.
- Added Encode/Decode encoding and decoding functions.

### Security

- Support for managing path permissions for select into through creating Stage.

### Tools

#### mo_dump tool (logical backup)

- Starting from this iteration, modump is managed in a separate repo (<https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo_dump>).
- Supports exporting DDLs separately.
- Supports exporting multiple databases and tables.
- mo_backup tool (physical backup)
- Supports file systems and object storage as storage media for backup and restoration.

#### mo_ctl_standalone Tool

- Supports automatic data backup.
- Supports automatic log table data cleaning.
- Supports converting data files from CSV format to insert or load data inline format.
- Supports automatic docker image building.
- Supports docker mode for standalone deployment.

#### mo_ctl_distributed Tool

- Supports one-click installation and uninstallation of distributed clusters.
- Supports start/stop, upgrade/rollback operations for matrixone clusters.
- Supports installing matrixone clusters in different k8s clusters.

#### mo_operator tool

- Supports configuring custom S3 certificates.
- Supports backup and recovery, and management of backup data for matrixone clusters via API.
- Supports setting optimized Go GC strategies automatically for matrixone clusters.
- Supports enabling Python UDF for matrixone clusters.
- Supports integration of matrixone on Kubernetes with Prometheus.

### MySQL Compatibility

- Remove hundreds of MySQL-incompatible reserved keywords.

## Known Issues

- Secondary Index doesn't apply for IN queries.
- Kafka connector works only in a standlone deployment.
- Occasional system hung under high concurrency workload.
- Memory leak occasionally happens and may lead to an OOM error.
