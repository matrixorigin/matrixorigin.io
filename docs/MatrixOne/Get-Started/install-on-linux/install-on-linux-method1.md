# **Building from source code in Linux**

This document will guide you to deploy a standalone MatrixOne in a Linux environment using source code. You can use the [mo_ctl](https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone) tool to help you deploy and manage MatrixOne.

MatrixOne supports x86 and ARM Linux systems. This article uses the Debian11.1 x86 architecture as an example to to show the entire deployment process. If you use the Ubuntu system, it should be noted that there is no root authority by default. It is recommended to add `sudo` to all the commands in the process.

## Pre-dependency Reference

To install and use the stand-alone MatrixOne through source code, you need to depend on the following software packages.

| Dependent software | Version |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| golang | 1.20 or later |
| gcc | gcc8.5 or later|
| git | 2.20 or later |
| MySQL Client | 8.0 or later |

## Step 1: Install Dependency

### 1. Install Go

1. Click <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank">Go Download and install</a> to enter its official documentation, and follow the installation steps to complete the **Go** installation.

2. To verify whether **Go** is installed, please execute the code `go version`. When **Go** is installed successfully, the example code line is as follows:  

    ```
    go version go1.20.4 linux/amd64
    ```

### 2. Install GCC

1. Debian 11.1 generally comes with GCC version 9.0 or above. To verify whether the GCC is installed:

    ```
    gcc -v
    bash: gcc: command not found
    ```

    As shown in the code, the version of GCC is not displayed, the **GCC** environment needs to be installed.

2. Click <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/" target="_blank">GCC Download and install</a> to enter its official documentation, and follow the installation steps to complete the **GCC** installation.

3. To verify whether **GCC** is installed, execute the code `gcc -v`. When **GCC** is installed successfully, the example code line is as follows (only part of the code is displayed):

    ```
    Using built-in specs.
    COLLECT_GCC=gcc
    ...
    Thread model: posix
    gcc version 9.3.1 20200408 (Red Hat 9.3.1-2) (GCC)
    ```

### 3. Install Git

1. To verify whether **Git** is installed, execute the code `git version`. As shown in the code, if the version of git is not displayed, it means that **Git** needs to be installed.

    ```
    git version
    -bash: git: command not found
    ```

2. Install **Git** with the following command:

    ```
    sudo apt install git
    ```

3. To verify whether **Git** is installed, please execute the code `git version`, the code line example of a successful installation is as follows:

    ```
    git version
    git version 2.40.0
    ```

### 4. Install MySQL Client

The Debian11.1 version does not have MySQL Client installed by default, so it needs to be downloaded and installed manually.

1. To install MySQL Client, you need to use the `wget` download tool, `wget` is used to download files from the specified URL. Execute the following commands in sequence to install `wget`:

    ```
    ## Update the software source list cache
    sudo apt udpate
    ## install wget
    sudo apt install wget
    ```

    After the installation is complete, please enter the following command to verify:

    ```
    wget -V
    ```

    The result of a successful installation (only a part of the code is displayed) is as follows:

    ```
    GNU Wget 1.21.3 built on linux-gnu.
    ...
    Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    ...
    ```

2. Execute the following commands in sequence to install MySQL Client:

    ```
    wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.22-1_all.deb
    sudo dpkg -i ./mysql-apt-config_0.8.22-1_all.deb
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mysql-client
    ```

3. Execute the command `mysql --version` to test whether MySQL is available. The result of the successful installation is as follows:

    ```
    mysql --version
    mysql  Ver 8.0.33 for Linux on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
    ```

## Step 2: Install the mo_ctl tool

[mo_ctl](https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone) is a command-line tool for deploying, installing, and managing MatrixOne. It is very convenient to perform various operations on MatrixOne. See [mo_ctl Tool](../../Maintain/mo_ctl.md) for complete usage details.

### 1. Install the mo_ctl tool

The mo_ctl tool can be installed through the following command:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone/main/install.sh && bash +x ./install.sh
```

After the installation is complete, verify whether the installation is successful through the `mo_ctl` command:

```
root@VM-16-2-debian:~# mo_ctl
Usage             : mo_ctl [option_1] [option_2]

[option_1]      : available: connect | ddl_connect | deploy | get_branch | get_cid | get_conf | help | pprof | precheck | restart | set_conf | sql | start | status | stop | uninstall | upgrade | watchdog
  1) connect      : connect to mo via mysql client using connection info configured
  2) ddl_convert  : convert ddl file to mo format from other types of database
  3) deploy       : deploy mo onto the path configured
  4) get_branch   : upgrade or downgrade mo from current version to a target commit id or stable version
  5) get_cid      : print mo git commit id from the path configured
  6) get_conf     : get configurations
  7) help         : print help information
  8) pprof        : collect pprof information
  9) precheck     : check pre-requisites for mo_ctl
  10) restart     : a combination operation of stop and start
  11) set_conf    : set configurations
  12) sql         : execute sql from string, or a file or a path containg multiple files
  13) start       : start mo-service from the path configured
  14) status      : check if there's any mo process running on this machine
  15) stop        : stop all mo-service processes found on this machine
  16) uninstall   : uninstall mo from path MO_PATH=/data/mo//matrixone
  17) upgrade     : upgrade or downgrade mo from current version to a target commit id or stable version
  18) watchdog    : setup a watchdog crontab task for mo-service to keep it alive  
  e.g.            : mo_ctl status

  [option_2]        : Use " mo_ctl [option_1] help " to get more info
  e.g.            : mo_ctl deploy help
```

### 2. Set mo_ctl parameters (Optional)

Some parameters in the mo_ctl tool need to be set and you can view all current parameters through `mo_ctl get_conf`.

```
root@VM-16-2-debian:~# mo_ctl get_conf
2023-08-23 18:23:35.444 UTC+0800    [INFO]    Below are all configurations set in conf file /root/mo_ctl/conf/env.sh
MO_PATH="/data/mo/"
MO_LOG_PATH="${MO_PATH}/matrixone/logs"
MO_HOST="127.0.0.1"
MO_PORT="6001"
MO_USER="root"
MO_PW="111"
MO_DEPLOY_MODE="host"
MO_REPO="matrixorigin/matrixone"
MO_IMAGE_PREFIX="nightly"
MO_IMAGE_FULL=""
MO_CONTAINER_NAME="mo"
MO_CONTAINER_PORT="6001"
MO_CONTAINER_DEBUG_PORT="12345"
CHECK_LIST=("go" "gcc" "git" "mysql" "docker")
GCC_VERSION="8.5.0"
CLANG_VERSION="13.0"
GO_VERSION="1.20"
MO_GIT_URL="https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git"
MO_DEFAULT_VERSION="1.0.0-rc1"
GOPROXY="https://goproxy.cn,direct"
STOP_INTERVAL="5"
START_INTERVAL="2"
MO_DEBUG_PORT="9876"
MO_CONF_FILE="${MO_PATH}/matrixone/etc/launch/launch.toml"
RESTART_INTERVAL="2"
PPROF_OUT_PATH="/tmp/pprof-test/"
PPROF_PROFILE_DURATION="30"
```

Generally, the parameters that may need to be adjusted are as follows:

````
mo_ctl set_conf MO_PATH="/data/mo/matrixone" # Set custom MatrixOne download path
mo_ctl set_conf MO_GIT_URL="https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git" # For the problem of slow downloading from the original GitHub address, set the proxy download address
mo_ctl set_conf MO_DEFAULT_VERSION="1.0.0-rc1" # Set the version of MatrixOne downloaded
````

## Step 3: Get MatrixOne code

Depending on your needs, choose whether you want to keep your code up to date, or if you want to get the latest stable version of the code.

=== "Get the MatrixOne(Develop Version) code to build"

     The **main** branch is the default branch, the code on the main branch is always up-to-date but not stable enough.

     ```
     mo_ctl deploy main
     ```

=== "Get the MatrixOne(Stable Version) code to build"

     ```
     mo_ctl deploy 1.0.0-rc1
     ```

## Step 4: Launch MatrixOne server

Launch the MatrixOne service through the `mo_ctl start` command.

If the operation is regular, the following log will appear. The relevant operation logs of MatrixOne will be in `/data/mo/logs/`.

```
root@VM-16-2-debian:~# mo_ctl start
2023-07-07_09:55:01    [INFO]    No mo-service is running
2023-07-07_09:55:01    [INFO]    Starting mo-service: cd /data/mo//matrixone/ && /data/mo//matrixone/mo-service -daemon -debug-http :9876 -launch /data/mo//matrixone/etc/launch/launch.toml >/data/mo//logs/stdout-20230707_095501.log 2>/data/mo//logs/stderr-20230707_095501.log
2023-07-07_09:55:01    [INFO]    Wait for 2 seconds

2023-07-07_09:55:03    [INFO]    Pids:
2023-07-07_09:55:03    [INFO]    748128
2023-07-07_09:55:03    [INFO]    Start succeeded
```

!!! note
    The initial startup of MatrixOne approximately takes 20 to 30 seconds. After a brief wait, you can connect to MatrixOne using the MySQL client.

## Step 5: Connect to MatrixOne

One-click connection to MatrixOne service through `mo_ctl connect` command.

This command will invoke the MySQL Client tool to connect to the MatrixOne service automatically.

```
root@VM-16-2-debian:~# mo_ctl connect
2023-07-07_10:30:20    [INFO]    Checking connectivity
2023-07-07_10:30:20    [INFO]    Ok, connecting for user ...
