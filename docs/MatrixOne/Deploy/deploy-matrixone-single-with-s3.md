# Deploy a stand-alone MatrixOne based on S3

This article provides an example of how to deploy a stand-alone MatrixOne based on S3. Different from the general stand-alone deployment method, this method uses S3 as the storage medium of MatrixOne, instead of directly using the local disk of the host machine.

## Applicable scenarios

This deployment pattern is ideal for testing timing scenarios. Because the time series data has the characteristics of high speed and large amount of data, the use of S3 with nearly unlimited capacity as a storage medium can well meet these requirements, thus avoiding the limitation of insufficient local disk space in a single computer.

!!! note
    This deployment model is recommended only for development and testing scenarios, but not for production environments. For production environments, it is recommended to use a distributed deployment model based on k8s+s3.

## Precondition

Prepare a host machine and configure S3 storage media, including but not limited to: authentication key pair, access endpoint, area (privatization can be ignored), bucket name path, etc. In addition, it is recommended to place the host of MatrixOne stand-alone deployment and S3 object storage in the same intranet to ensure that the network will not become a performance bottleneck.

## Operation steps

### Scenario 1: MatrixOne with Minio

#### Deploy a stand-alone MatrixOne

For reference [Deploy MatrixOne on a stand-alone basis](../Get-Started/install-standalone-matrixone.md), complete the deployment of the stand-alone version of MatrixOne, and do not start it after deployment.

#### Modifying the MatrixOne Configuration File

The host deployment mode (i.e. source code or binary deployment) is taken as an example below. If the container deployment mode is used, the configuration file needs to be mounted in the container. See the specific operation steps **Containerized deployment mode** section. In the host deployment mode, the default configuration file is generally located in etc/launch/. Generally, the deployment path of Mo and the information of S3 need to be modified.

- Back up the default configuration folder

```bash
cd /your/mo-path/
cp -rp etc/launch etc/launch-default
```

#### Confirm data write to S3 (MinIO)

We can use MC, minio's official command-line client tool, to confirm that Mo's data was written to the corresponding bucket. For the specific usage of MC, please refer to the following documentation:
<https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html>

```

### Scenario 2: MatrixOne with S3

This section describes how to deploy a standalone version of MatrixOne based on object storage that follows the standard S3 protocol, using Tencent Cloud COS as an example. For other similar S3 service providers, such as AWS and Alibaba Cloud OSS, their configuration methods are similar, and you can refer to this step. Compared with MinIO, the deployment steps based on Tencent Cloud COS are basically the same except that the configuration files are slightly different. The differences in the configuration files will be highlighted below, and other steps will not be repeated.

### Containerized deployment mode

According to the scenario, configure the CN. Toml, TN. Toml, and log. Toml file according to the above steps. After that, put these files in the same directory, for example,/data/Mo _ confs. In addition, you need to configure a launch. Toml file with the following contents:

- Modifying the MatrixOne Configuration File

```
logservices = [
    "./etc/log.toml",
]

tnservices = [
    "./etc/tn.toml"
]

cnservices = [
    "./etc/cn.toml"
]
```

- Set Mo _ CTL Tools Configuration

```bash
#Configure cn.toml, tn.toml and log.toml first.
mo_ctl set_conf MO_CONTAINER_IMAGE=matrixorigin/matrixone/3.0.1 #Setting up mirroring
mo_ctl set_conf MO_CONTAINER_NAME=mo # Setting the container name
mo_ctl set_conf MO_CONTAINER_CONF_HOST_PATH=/data/mo_confs/ # Set the directory on the host machine where the mo configuration file is stored
mo_ctl set_conf MO_CONTAINER_CONF_CON_FILE="/etc/launch.toml" # Set the path to the configuration file inside the container when the container starts up
mo_ctl set_conf MO_CONTAINER_DATA_HOST_PATH="/data/mo-data/" # Setting the host data directory for mounting to containers
mo_ctl set_conf MO_CONTAINER_AUTO_RESTART="yes"   # Configure the container to restart automatically after an abnormal exit
```

- Start the MatrixOne container
  
Set the MatrixOne deployment mode to container and start the MatrixOne container

```
mo_ctl set_conf MO_DEPLOY_MODE=docker
mo_ctl start
```
