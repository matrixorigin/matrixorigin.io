# Cluster Topology Planning Overview

MatrixOne database cluster is an architecture for distributed deployment of database systems on multiple physical or virtual servers, aiming to provide high availability and scalability. By distributing the database to multiple servers, the cluster can realize data redundancy backup, load balancing, and fault recovery, thereby providing higher performance and reliability.

The database cluster topology can choose a suitable architecture for business and performance requirements. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of different topologies and applicable scenarios will help you design a stable and efficient database cluster architecture.

## Topology deployment document

We recommend deployment documents for three environments, refer to:

- [Experience Environment Deployment Plan](experience-deployment-topology.md)
- [Minimum Production Environment Deployment Plan](minimal-deployment-topology.md)
- [Recommended Production Environment Deployment Plan](recommended-prd-deployment-topology.md)
