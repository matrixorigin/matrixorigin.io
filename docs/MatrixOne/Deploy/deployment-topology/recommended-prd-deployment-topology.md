# Recommended Production Environment Deployment Plan

The recommended configuration of the MatrixOne distributed cluster described in this document is suitable for production environments and possesses robust performance and reliability. This configuration can support billions of data with thousands of concurrent OLTP operations or handle OLAP operations with tens of TB data volume.

This configuration provides a high degree of availability guarantee. Whether it is Kubernetes, Minio, or MatrixOne, the system can operate normally when a node goes offline. This means the system has strong fault tolerance and can maintain business continuity in node failure.

Below are the details for the recommended production environment deployment plan:

## Software and Hardware Configuration Requirements

| Module                      | Number of Units (Physical and Virtual Machines are acceptable) | Node Role   | CPU Configuration | Memory Configuration | Network Card         | System Disk Configuration                                   | Kubernetes Disk Configuration                              | Data Disk Configuration                                    |
