# MatrixOne System Database and Tables

MatrixOne system database and tables are where MatrixOne stores system information. We can access the system information through them. MatrixOne creates 6 system databases at initialization: `mo_catalog`, `information_schema`, `system_metrcis`, `system`, `mysql`, and `mo_task`. `mo_task` is under development and have no direct impact on users.
The other system databases and table functions are described in this document.

The system can only modify system databases and tables, and users can only read from them.

## `mo_catalog` database

`mo_catalog` stores the metadata of MatrixOne objects: databases, tables, columns, system variables, accounts, users, and roles.

Start with MatrixOne 0.6 has introduced the concept of multi-account, the default `sys` account and other accounts have slightly different behaviors. The system table `mo_account`, which serves the multi-tenancy management, is only visible for the `sys` account; the other accounts don't see this table.

## `information_schema` database

Information Schema provides an ANSI-standard way of viewing system metadata. MatrixOne also provides a number of custom `information_schema` tables, in addition to the tables included for MySQL compatibility.

Many `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables have a corresponding `SHOW` command. The benefit of querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is that it is possible to join between tables.
