## Install mo_ctl

Depending on whether you have Internet access, you can choose to install the `mo_ctl` tool online or offline. You need to be careful to always execute commands as root or with sudo privileges (and add sudo before each command). Meanwhile, `install.sh` will use the `unzip` command to extract `the mo_ctl` package. Make sure the `unzip` command is installed.

### Install online

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone/main/install.sh && sudo bash +x ./install.sh

# Alternate address
wget https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone/blob/main/install.sh && sudo bash +x install.sh 
```

For users running this command in a macOS environment, if you are a non-root user, run `install.sh` with the following statement:

```
sudo -u $(whoami) bash +x ./install.sh 
```

### Offline installation

```
# 1. Download the installation script to your local computer before uploading it to the installation machine
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone/main/install.sh 
wget https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -O mo_ctl.zip

# If the original github address downloads too slowly, you can try downloading from the following mirror address:
wget https://mirror.ghproxy.com/https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone/blob/main/install.sh 
wget https://githubfast.com/matrixorigin/mo_ctl_standalone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -O mo_ctl.zip

# 2. Install from offline package
bash +x ./install.sh mo_ctl.zip 
```

## Get started quickly

The Deployment Standalone Edition of MatrixOne can be quickly installed by following these steps, and the detailed guide provides a view of the [Standalone Deployment MatrixOne](../Get-Started/install-standalone-matrixone.md).

1. Use the command `mo_ctl help` to view the tool guide.

2. Use the command `mo_ctl precheck` to see if the predependencies are met.

3. Use the command `mo_ctl get_conf` to set the relevant parameters, which may be configured as follows:

    ```
    mo_ctl set_conf MO_PATH="/data/mo/matrixone" #Set custom MatrixOne download path 
    mo_ctl set_conf MO_GIT_URL="https://githubfast.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git" #Set mirror download address for slow download of github original address
    ```

4. Install and deploy the latest stable version of MatrixOne using the command `mo_ctl deploy`.

5. Start the MatrixOne service with the command `mo_ctl start`.

6. Use the command `mo_ctl connect` to connect to the MatrixOne service.

              : mo_ctl restart force   # stop all mo-services with kill -9 command and start mo-serivce under path of conf MO_PATH
```

### connect - connect to the MatrixOne service via mysql-client

Use `mo_ctl connect` to connect to the MatrixOne service, the connection parameters are set in the `mo_ctl` tool.

```
mo_ctl connect help
Usage         : mo_ctl connect # connect to mo via mysql client using connection info configured

              : mo_ctl setconf MO_PATH=/data/mo/matrixone                                       # set single configuration
```

!!! note
    When the path to set_conf's settings contains variables such as `${MO_PATH}`, `$` needs to be preceded by `\`, for example:

    ```bash
