## Quick Start

You can quickly install and deploy the stand-alone version of MatrixOne through the following steps. For more information, see [Deploy standalone MatrixOne](../Get-Started/install-standalone-matrixone.md).

1. Use the `mo_ctl help` command to view the tool guide.

2. Use the `mo_ctl precheck` command to check whether the pre-dependency conditions are met.

3. Use the `mo_ctl get_conf` command to set relevant parameters, and the possible parameter configurations are as follows:

    ```
    # check default parameter values
    mo_ctl set_conf MO_PATH="/data/mo/matrixone" # set your own mo path
    mo_ctl set_conf MO_GIT_URL="https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git" # in case have network issues, you can set this conf by overwriting default value MO_GIT_URL="https:// github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git"
    ```

4. Use the `mo_ctl deploy`command to install and deploy the latest stable version of MatrixOne.

5. Use the `mo_ctl start` command to launch the MatrixOne service with the command .

6. Use the `mo_ctl connect` command to connect to the MatrixOne service.
