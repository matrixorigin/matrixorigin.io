# MO-Tester

## Note on Tool Naming Convention

Regarding the `mo_*` tools and naming convention (like mo_ctl, mo_tester, mo_datax_writer, etc.), these tools are part of the core infrastructure and may be referenced by other systems or scripts. The naming convention has been preserved for compatibility reasons:

1. For Tools (`mo_*`):

   - All tool names (like `mo_ctl`, `mo_tester`, etc.) are maintained as is

   - This ensures compatibility with existing scripts, automation, and user workflows

   - These are legacy tool names that remain valid and functional

This naming convention is maintained to prevent breaking existing workflows and integrations. While the product has been rebranded, these tool names continue to work as before to ensure a smooth transition for users.
