# Time Zone Support

The time zone in OmniFabric is decided by three `time_zone` system variables: `global.time_zone`, `session.time_zone`, `global.system_time_zone`.

* `global.system_time_zone` indicates the server system time zone. When the server starts, it attempts to determine the time zone of the host machine and uses it to set the system_time_zone system variable.

* The server current time zone. The `global.time_zone` system variable indicates the time zone the server currently is operating in. The initial time_zone value is 'SYSTEM', which indicates that the server time zone is the same as the system time zone.

You can use the following statement to set the global server time_zone value at runtime. But it won't be effective in the current session, only if you exit and reconnect to OmniFabric you may see the time_zone affected.

```
> SET GLOBAL time_zone = timezone;
```

* Per-session time zones. Each client that connects has its own session time zone setting, given by the session time_zone variable. Initially, the session variable takes its value from the global time_zone variable, but the client can change its own time zone with this statement. This setting will only last during the current session.

```
SET time_zone = timezone;
```

You can use the following statement to view the current values of the global, client-specific and system time zones:

```sql
> SELECT @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone, @@global.system_time_zone;

+-------------+-------------+--------------------+
| @@time_zone | @@time_zone | @@system_time_zone |

+-------------+-------------+--------------------+
| timezone    | +08:00      | CST                |

+-------------+-------------+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

To set the format of the value of the time_zone:

- The value `SYSTEM` indicates that the time zone should be the same as the server system time zone.

- The value `UTC` indicates that the time zone is set to Coordinated Universal Time. Only `UTC` as time zone abbreviation is supported.

- The value can be given as a string indicating an offset from UTC of the form `HH:MM` with a + or -, such as `+10:00` or `-06:00`. The permitted range is `-13:59` to `+14:00`, inclusive.

The current session time zone setting affects the display and storage of time values that are zone-sensitive. This includes the values displayed by functions such as `NOW()` and values stored in and retrieved from TIMESTAMP columns.

The session time zone setting does not affect values displayed by functions such as UTC_TIMESTAMP() or values in DATE, TIME, or DATETIME columns.

!!! note
    Only the values of the Timestamp data type is affected by time zone. This is because the Timestamp data type uses the literal value + time zone information. Other data types, such as Datetime/Date/Time, do not have time zone information, thus their values are not affected by the changes of time zone.

```sql
> SELECT @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone, @@global.system_time_zone;

+-------------+-------------+--------------------+
| @@time_zone | @@time_zone | @@system_time_zone |

+-------------+-------------+--------------------+
| SYSTEM      | SYSTEM      | CST                |

+-------------+-------------+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

> create table t (ts timestamp, dt datetime);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> set @@time_zone = 'UTC';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into t values ('2017-09-30 11:11:11', '2017-09-30 11:11:11');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> set @@time_zone = '+08:00';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from t;

+---------------------+---------------------+
| ts                  | dt                  |

+---------------------+---------------------+
| 2017-09-30 19:11:11 | 2017-09-30 11:11:11 |

+---------------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In this example, no matter how you adjust the value of the time zone, the value of the Datetime data type is not affected. But the displayed value of the Timestamp data type changes if the time zone information changes. In fact, the value that is stored in the storage does not change, it's just displayed differently according to different time zone setting.

!!! note
    Time zone is involved during the conversion of the value of Timestamp and Datetime, which is handled based on the current time_zone.

## Changing OmniFabric Time Zone

1. View the current time and time zone:

```sql
> select now();

+----------------------------+
| now()                      |

+----------------------------+
| 2022-10-14 18:38:27.876181 |

+----------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

> show variables like "%time_zone%";

+------------------+--------+
| Variable_name    | Value  |

+------------------+--------+
| system_time_zone | CST    |
| time_zone        | SYSTEM |

+------------------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- `time_zone` indicates that OmniFabric uses the system time zone.

- `system_time_zone` indicates the time zone which server system uses.

2. modify the time zone:

```
set global time_zone = '+08:00';
set time_zone = '+08:00';
```

- `set global time_zone = '+08:00';`: Change the global time zone to Beijing time if we are in the east eight zones.

- `set time_zone = '+08:00';`: Change the time zone of the current session.

## Constraints

Only `(+/-)HH:MM` form and `UTC` is supported for setting `time_zone` values.
