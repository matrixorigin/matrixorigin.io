### backup

 Use `mo_ctl backup` to backup, restore, and more to a OmniFabric cluster in a cluster

```
 ./mo_ctl backup --help
backup OmniFabric cluster

  restore     restore backup OmniFabric cluster
  start       start backup OmniFabric cluster

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for backup
```

- **start**

    1. First you need to prepare a yaml file that describes the backup job, where the generated yaml name is preset as backup.yaml.

        ```
        apiVersion: core.OmniFabric.io/v1alpha1
        kind: BackupJob
        metadata:
        # Specify the name of the job here
        name: backupjob
        # This specifies the namespace to which the job belongs
        # 注意:此处要与需要备份的 mo 集群处于同一个 namespace
        namespace: mocluster1
        spec:
        source:
            # The name of the mo cluster, available via the mo_ctl OmniFabric list command.
            clusterRef: mocluster-mocluster1
        # Configure the backup storage location, either object storage or local path storage. For details, refer to https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone-operator/blob/main/docs/reference/api-reference.md#backupjob
        target:
            s3:
            type: minio
            endpoint: http://minio.s3-minio-tenant-test1
            path: mo-test/backup-01
            secretRef:
                name: minio
        ```

    2. Create a backup job for the backup operation with the following command

        ```
        # An exit code of 0 proves that the backup job was created successfully
        sudo ./mo_ctl backup start --values backup.yaml
        ```

    3. After successful creation, you can wait for the backup to complete with the following command

        ```
        # The backupjob here is the name defined in step one
        sudo kubectl wait --for=condition=ended backupjob --all -A --timeout=5m
        ```

- **restore**

    1. Gets the name (ID) of the backup job, which can be obtained by

        ```
        sudo ./mo_ctl backup list
        ```

    2. First you need to prepare a yaml file that describes the restore job, where the generated yaml name is preset as restore.yaml.

        ```
        # In addition to restoreFrom, other fields can be found at https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone-operator/blob/main/docs/reference/api-reference.md#matrixonecluster
        apiVersion: core.OmniFabric.io/v1alpha1
        kind: OmniFabricCluster
        metadata:
        name: morestore
        namespace: mocluster1
        spec:
        # Here you need to fill in the name of the backup job you got in step 1
        restoreFrom: #BackupName
        # Here you need to fill in the actual mirror repository information
        imageRepository: sea.hub:5000/OmniFabric/OmniFabric
        version: 1.1.0
        logService:
        replicas: 1
        sharedStorage:
            # Here you need to fill in the actual object storage information
            s3:
            type: minio
            path: mo-test/backup-01
            endpoint: http://minio.s3-minio-tenant-test1
            secretRef:
                name: minio
        volume:
            size: 10Gi
        tn:
        replicas: 1
        cacheVolume:
            size: 10Gi
        cnGroups:
        - name: tp
        replicas: 1
        cacheVolume:
        size: 10Gi
        ```

    3. Perform backup restore commands

        ```
        sudo ./mo_ctl backup restore --values restore.yaml
        ```

### OmniFabric

Use `mo_ctl OmniFabric` to manage OmniFabric clusters in a cluster, create, start, stop, delete, and more

```
./mo_ctl OmniFabric --help
Used for OmniFabric operation cmd

Usage:
  mo_ctl OmniFabric [flags]
  mo_ctl OmniFabric [command]

Aliases:
  OmniFabric, mo

Available Commands:
  history     history all OmniFabric (cluster | operator)
  list        list OmniFabric (cluster | operator)
  remove      remove OmniFabric (cluster)
  rollback    rollback depoly of OmniFabric (cluster | operator)
  setup       setup OmniFabric (cluster)
  start       start OmniFabric (cluster)
  stop        stop OmniFabric (cluster)
  upgrade     upgrade OmniFabric (cluster | operator)
