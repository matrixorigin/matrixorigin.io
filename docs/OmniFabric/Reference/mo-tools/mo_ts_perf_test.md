# mo_ts_perf_test Tool Guide

`mo_ts_perf_test` is a timed write and query test tool for OmniFabric.

!!! Note
    The `mo_ts_perf_test` tool is currently only supported for deployment on Linux system x86 architectures.

## Pre-dependency

OmniFabric.

- Installed wget

## Install mo_ts_perf_test

```bash
wget https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo_ts_perf_test/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.1.zip unzip v1.0.1.zip
```

## Configuration

Modify the db.conf configuration file in the OmniFabric/conf directory as appropriate

```bash
root@host-10-222-4-8:~/soft/perf/mo_ts_perf_test-1.0.0/OmniFabric/conf# cat db.conf
[dbInfo]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 6001
user = root
password = 111
tablePrefix = d
point_query_ts_condition = '2017-07-14 10:40:06.379'
loadFilePath = /root/soft/perf/
```

**Configuration instructions:**

- tablePrefix: When writing to multiple tables for lookup, the prefix of the table name, for example, with a value of d, will automatically create three tables: d0, d1, d2;

- point_query_ts_condition: Filter criteria value for the ts field when querying for points;

- loadFilePath: When importing for load data infile, the directory where the local csv file is to be imported; note: the loadFilePath path must be local to the MO database, that is: the csv file is to be placed on the server where the MO database is located.

## Perform write tests with mo-write

mo-write is the MO write test tool with the command:

```bash
mo-write -T -r -n -retry -mode -txc -tType -wType -wType
```

!!! note
    All writes are to tables under the test database, single-table writes are to d0 tables, multi-table writes are to d0, d1, d2, and so on (the number is determined by the client data).

**Parameter description**

- -T: Indicates the number of clients writing concurrently, which defaults to 7;

- -r: Indicates the number of data rows submitted per write, default 10000;

- -n: Indicates the total number of data rows to import per client, default 500,000;

- -retry: Indicates the number of tests (eventually the average write speed is calculated automatically), default 1;

- -mode: Indicates write mode, single for single table writes, multi for multi table writes, default multi;

- -txc: Indicates the number of writes per transaction commit, value >=0, default 0 (0 means no transactions open);

- -tType: Indicates the type of table written to, ts, tsPK, intPK, respectively, default ts, ts for a time series table without a primary key, tsPK for a time series table with a primary key, and intPK for a normal table with a primary key of type int;

- -wType: Indicates the type of write, divided into insert, loadLine, loadFile, insert denotes insert into values for writing data, loadLine denotes load data inline for writing, and loadFile denotes load data infile for importing into a local csv file (local csv data file fetch: can be automatically generated in its parent data directory via sr-write).

### Examples

- **Example 1**

```bash

======== avg test: 472620.159086/1 = 472620.159086 records/second txc=0 ===========
```

- **Example 2**

Each of the 2 clients uses insert into to write 100,000 pieces of data to a time series table (d0) with a primary key:

```bash
root@host-10-222-4-8:~/soft/perf/mo_ts_perf_test-1.0.1/OmniFabric/mo-write# ./mo-write -T 2 -n 100000 -mode single -tType tsPK -wType insert

======== avg test: 17561.347089/1 = 17561.347089 records/second txc=0 ===========
```

- **Example 3**

1 client tests a set of data by writing 500,000 pieces of data to a normal table (d0) with a primary key of type int using load data inline:

```bash
root@host-10-222-4-8:~/soft/perf/mo_ts_perf_test-1.0.1/OmniFabric/mo-write# ./mo-write -T 1 -tType=intPK -retry 1
r=10000, T=1, n=500000, mode=multi, retry=1, txc=0, tType=intPK, wType=loadLine
dbConfig:{127.0.0.1 6001 root 111 d '2017-07-14 10:40:06.379'   /root/soft/perf/}

```

- **Example 4**

Using load data inline, 8 clients write 500,000 pieces of data to a time series table (d0......d7) without a primary key via a transaction commit (10 writes per commit), automatically testing 3 groups for averaging:

```bash
root@host-10-222-4-8:~/soft/perf/mo_ts_perf_test-1.0.1/OmniFabric/mo-write# ./mo-write -T 8 -txc 10 -retry 3
r=10000, T=8, n=500000, mode=multi, retry=3, txc=10, tType=ts, wType=loadLine
dbConfig:{127.0.0.1 6001 root 111 d '2017-07-14 10:40:06.379'   /root/soft/perf/}

## Perform query testing with mo-query

mo-query is a query testing tool that tests the time of queries such as select \*, point queries, common aggregate queries, time windows, etc. All queries query only the table d0 in the test library. The command is:

```bash
mo-query -T
```

**Parameter description**

**-T:** Indicates the number of clients executing select * queries concurrently. Defaults to 1.

### Examples

```bash
root@host-10-222-4-8:~/soft/perf/mo_ts_perf_test-1.0.1/OmniFabric/mo-query# ./mo-query -T 5
T=5
