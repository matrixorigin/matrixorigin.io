# Overview

Apache Spark is a distributed computing engine designed to efficiently handle large-scale data. It uses distributed parallel computing to spread the tasks of data splitting,computing and merging over multiple computers,thus realizing efficient data processing and analysis.

## Application scenarios

- Large-scale data processing and analysis

    Spark is capable of handling huge amounts of data, increasing processing efficiency through parallel computing tasks. It is widely used in data processing and analysis in finance, telecommunications, medical and other fields.

- stream data processing

    Spark Streaming allows real-time processing of data streams into batch data for analysis and storage. This is useful in real-time data analysis scenarios such as online advertising, network security, etc.

- Machine learning

    Spark provides a machine learning library (MLlib) that supports multiple machine learning algorithms and model training for machine learning applications such as recommendation systems, image recognition, and more.

- Figure calculation

    Spark's Graph Calculation Library (GraphX) supports multiple graph calculation algorithms for graph analysis scenarios such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and more.
