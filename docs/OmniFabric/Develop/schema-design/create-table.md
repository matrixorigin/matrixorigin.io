# Create a Table

This document introduces how to create tables using the SQL statement and the related best practices. In the previous document, you created a database named *modatabase*. In this document, you will create a table in the database.

## Before you start

Before reading this document, make sure that the following tasks are completed:

- Build a OmniFabric Cluster in OmniFabric.
- Read the [Database Schema Design Overview](overview.md).
- The database has been created.

## What is a table

A table is a logical object in OmniFabric cluster that is subordinate to the database. It is used to store the data.

Tables save data records in the form of rows and columns. A table has at least one column. If you have defined n columns, each row of data has exactly the same fields as the n columns.

## Name a table

The first step for creating a table is to give your table a name. Do not use meaningless names that will cause great distress to yourself or your colleagues in the future. It is recommended that you follow your company or organization's table naming convention.

The `CREATE TABLE` statement usually takes the following form:

```sql
CREATE TABLE {table_name} ({elements});
```

For more information on `CREATE TABLE` statement, see [CREATE TABLE](../../Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/create-table.md).

**Parameter description**

- {table_name}: The name of the table to be created.

- {elements}: A comma-separated list of table elements, such as column definitions and primary key definitions.

## Define columns

A column is subordinate to a table. Each table has at least one column. Columns provide a structure to a table by dividing the values in each row into small cells of a single data type.

Column definitions typically take the following form.

```
{column_name} {data_type} {column_qualification}
```

**Parameter description**

- {column_name}: The column name.
- {data_type}: The column data type.
- {column_qualification}: Column qualifications.

Suppose you need to create a table to store the *NATION* information in the *modatabase* database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE NATION(
N_NATIONKEY  INTEGER NOT NULL,
N_NAME       CHAR(25) NOT NULL,
N_REGIONKEY  INTEGER NOT NULL,
N_COMMENT    VARCHAR(152),
);
```

**Explanations**

The following table explains the fields in the above example:

|Field name | Data type | Function | Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|N_NATIONKEY |INTEGER|The unique identifier of the nation|All identifiers should be of type INTEGER|
|N_NAME |CHAR|Ethnic name|Ethnic name is char type, and no more than 25 characters|
|N_REGIONKEY|INTEGER|Region code, unique identifier|All identifiers should be of type INTEGER|
|N_COMMENT|VARCHAR|comment information|varchar type, and no more than 152 characters|

OmniFabric supports many other column data types, including the integer types, floating-point types, date and time types. For more information, see [Data Types](../../Reference/Data-Types/data-types.md).

**Create a complex table**

Create a new table named *ORDERS*.

```sql
CREATE TABLE ORDERS(
O_ORDERKEY       BIGINT NOT NULL,
O_CUSTKEY        INTEGER NOT NULL,
O_ORDERSTATUS    CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
O_TOTALPRICE     DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
O_ORDERDATE      DATE NOT NULL,
O_ORDERPRIORITY  CHAR(15) NOT NULL,
O_CLERK          CHAR(15) NOT NULL,
O_SHIPPRIORITY   INTEGER NOT NULL,
O_COMMENT        VARCHAR(79) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (O_ORDERKEY)
);
```

This table contains more data types than the *NATION* table:

|Field name | Data type | Function | Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|O_TOTALPRICE|DECIMAL| O_TOTALPRICE is used to mark the price|The precision is 15, and the scale is 2; that is, the accuracy represents the total number of digits in the field value, and the scale means how many digits there are after the decimal point, for example decimal(5,2), that is, the precision is 5 when the ratio is 2, its value ranges from -999.99 to 999.99. decimal(6,1), when the accuracy is 6, and the scale is 1, its value range is from -99999.9 to 99999.9. |
|O_ORDERDATE|DATE|Date value|Date of the order|

## Select primary key

A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values uniquely identify a row in the table.

The primary key is defined in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. The primary key constraint requires that all constrained columns contain only `non-NULL` values.

A table can be created without a primary key or with a non-integer primary key.

### Set default value

To set a default value on a column, use the `DEFAULT` constraint. The default value allows you to insert data without specifying a value for each column.

You can use `DEFAULT` together with supported SQL functions to move the calculation of defaults out of the application layer, thus saving resources of the application layer. The resources consumed by the calculation do not disappear and are moved to the OmniFabric cluster. The following exemplifies setting the default value in the *t1* table:

```sql
create table t1(a int default (1), b int);
insert into t1(b) values(1), (1);
> select * from t1;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
|    1 |    1 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

The default value of a is 1.

You can also set the default value to the time when the value was inserted; see the simple example below:

```sql
-- Create the table and set the default value to the current time
CREATE TABLE t2 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO t2 (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'John'),
(2, 'Jane'),
(3, 'Mike');

> SELECT * FROM t2;
+------+------+---------------------+
| id | name | created_at |
+------+------+---------------------+
| 1 | John | 2023-07-10 11:57:27 |
| 2 | Jane | 2023-07-10 11:57:27 |
| 3 | Mike | 2023-07-10 11:57:27 |
+------+------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

After executing the above insert statement, each row's `created_at` column will be automatically set to the current time.

### Prevent duplicate values

If you need to prevent duplicate values in a column, you can use the `UNIQUE` constraint.

For example, to make sure that `N_NATIONKEY` are unique, you can rewrite the table creation SQL statement for the *NATION* table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE NATION(
N_NATIONKEY  INTEGER NOT NULL,
N_NAME       CHAR(25) NOT NULL,
N_REGIONKEY  INTEGER NOT NULL,
N_COMMENT    VARCHAR(152),
UNIQUE KEY (N_NATIONKEY)
);
```

If you try to insert the same value of*N_NATIONKEY* in the *NATION* table, an error is returned.

### Prevent null values

If you need to prevent null values in a column, you can use the `NOT NULL` constraint.

Use the nation's name as an example. In addition to the unique value of the national, it is also hoped that the name of the nation cannot be empty, so here you can write the creation SQL of the *NATION* table as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE NATION(
N_NATIONKEY  INTEGER NOT NULL,
N_NAME       CHAR(25) NOT NULL,
N_REGIONKEY  INTEGER NOT NULL,
N_COMMENT    VARCHAR(152),
PRIMARY KEY (N_NATIONKEY)
);
```

## Execute the SHOW TABLES statement

To view all tables under the *modatabase* database, use the `SHOW TABLES` statement.

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN `modatabase`;
```

Running results:

```
+----------------------+
| tables_in_modatabase |
+----------------------+
| nation               |
| orders               |
+----------------------+
```

## Guidelines to follow when creating a table

This section provides guidelines you need to follow when creating a table.

### Guidelines to follow when naming a table

- Use a fully-qualified table name (for example, `CREATE TABLE {database_name}. {table_name}`). If you do not specify the database name, OmniFabric uses the current database in your SQL session. If you do not use `USE {databasename};` to specify the database in your SQL session, OmniFabric returns an error.

- Use meaningful table names. For example, if you need to create a *NATION* table, you can use names: *NATION*, *t_user*,*users*, or follow your company or organization's naming convention.

- Multiple words are separated by an underscore, and it is recommended that the name is no more than 32 characters.

- Create a separate *DATABASE* for tables of different business modules and add comments accordingly.

### Guidelines to follow when defining columns

- Check the data types supported.

- Check the guidelines to follow for selecting primary keys and decide whether to use primary key columns.

- Check adding column constraints and decide whether to add constraints to the columns.

- Use meaningful column names. It is recommended that you follow your company or organization's table naming convention. If your company or organization does not have a corresponding naming convention, refer to the column naming convention.

### Guidelines to follow when selecting primary key

- Define a primary key or unique index within the table.
- Try to select meaningful columns as primary keys.
- For performance reasons, try to avoid storing extra-wide tables. It is not recommended that the number of table fields is over 60 and that the total data size of a single row is over 64K. It is recommended to split fields with too much data length to another table.
- It is not recommended to use complex data types.
- For the fields to be joined, ensure that the data types are consistent and avoid implicit conversion.
- Avoid defining primary keys on a single monotonic data column. If you use a single monotonic data column (for example, a column with the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute) to define the primary key, it might impact the write performance.
