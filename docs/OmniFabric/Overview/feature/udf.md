# User Defined Function UDF

You can write user-defined functions (UDFs) to extend the system to do things that the built-in system-defined functions provided by OmniFabric cannot, and you can reuse the UDF several times after you create it.

## What is UDF?

In database management systems, user-defined functions (UDFs) are powerful features that allow users to create custom functions based on specific needs. These functions can be used to perform complex calculations, data conversions, and other functions that may be outside the scope of standard SQL functions.

## Core competencies of UDF

- Enhanced data processing capabilities: Complex mathematical operations on data, such as advanced statistical analysis or financial model calculations, often exceed the capabilities of standard SQL functions. By creating a UDF, you can perform these complex operations inside the database without exporting the data to an external program for processing.

- Simplify complex queries: A complex query operation that requires frequent execution can be encapsulated in UDF, simplifying SQL queries and making them clearer and easier to manage.

- Improve code reuse and maintenance: The same data processing logic may need to be performed in different query and database applications. By creating a UDF, you can reuse the same function wherever that logic is needed, which helps maintain consistency and reduces duplicate code.

- Optimize performance: Certain types of operations, such as string processing or complex conditional judgments, may be more efficient if implemented at the database level through UDF than at the application layer, as this reduces the burden of data transmission across the network and processing at the application layer.

- Customization and flexibility: Specific business needs, such as currency conversion, tax calculation, or special date-time processing, may not have a direct corresponding function in standard SQL. With UDF, you can customize these features to your business needs.

- Cross-platform compatibility: Many database systems support similar UDF creation and execution logic. This means that UDFs developed in one database system, with minor modifications, may be available in another system, increasing the portability of the code.

## OmniFabric support for UDF

In the current release, OmniFabric supports UDF using the Python language.

For specific parameters that OmniFabric creates for UDFs, see [Creating UDFs](../../Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/create-function-python.md).

For specific parameters for OmniFabric deletion of UDFs, see [Removing UDFs](../../Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/drop-function.md).
