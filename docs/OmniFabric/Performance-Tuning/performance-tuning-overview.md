# SQL Performance Tuning Methods Overview

SQL performance tuning optimizes database queries and operations to improve performance and response time. Several standard performance tuning methods include:

- Index optimization: Indexes can speed up queries and improve database performance. By using the correct index type, selecting the right index columns, avoiding excessive indexing, and regularly rebuilding indexes, you can maximize the use of indexes to improve performance.

- Query optimization: By optimizing the structure of queries, avoiding unnecessary subqueries, using more efficient JOIN statements, and avoiding using OR operators, you can reduce the time and resources required for queries.

- Table structure optimization: Optimizing table structure, such as selecting the correct data types, avoiding NULL values, using appropriate constraints and default values, normalization, and denormalization, can reduce storage space and query time.

- Data volume control: By limiting the amount of data returned, paging, caching, using stored procedures, and other methods, you can reduce the time and resources required for queries.

- Server configuration optimization: By increasing server memory, adjusting database parameters, regularly cleaning logs and caches, and other methods, you can improve database performance and response time.

- Monitoring and debugging: Using database performance monitoring tools, debugging SQL queries, viewing database logs and error messages, and other methods can help identify and resolve performance issues.

It should be noted that SQL performance tuning is a complex process that requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as database structure, data volume, and query patterns. Continuous testing and validation of optimization results are also necessary to ultimately improve database performance and response time.

When executing SQL statements in OmniFabric, the system automatically plans and selects the optimal execution plan rather than simply querying according to the SQL statements. Currently, OmniFabric supports performance tuning through EXPLAIN interpretation of the execution plan and optimizing the physical arrangement of tables. To help you better tune SQL queries in OmniFabric, you can refer to the following documents on execution plans:

- [OmniFabric Query Execution Plan Overview](explain/explain-overview.md): Describes the concepts of OmniFabric execution plans.

- [Using EXPLAIN to learn the execution plan](explain/explain-walkthrough.md): Describes how to use the EXPLAIN statement to understand how OmniFabric executes a query.

- [Performance Tuning Best Practices](optimization-concepts/through-cluster-by.md): Describes the best practices of using Cluster by in OmniFabric for performance tuning and learning how to improve query performance.
