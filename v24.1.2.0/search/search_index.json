They are a fundamental part of the way a compiler works. C Cluster A distributed MatrixOne deployment, which acts as a single logical application. E Explicit Transactions Explicit Transaction has the beginning, ending and rollback of transactions with the command Begin Transaction, Commit Transaction and Rollback Transaction. I Implicit Transactions Implicit Transaction is the auto commit. There is no beginning or ending of the transaction. O Optimistic transaction Optimistic transaction, the optimistic transaction means that when the transaction starts, no conflict detection or lock will be performed, the current relevant data will be cached in the corresponding memory area, and the data will be added, deleted, or modified. P Pessimistic transaction Pessimistic transaction, the default transaction mode of MatrixOne, that is, when the transaction starts, it will assume that the transaction-related tables are in a state where write conflicts will occur and lock the corresponding data table or a data row in advance to complete the locking action Finally, the insertion, modification, or deletion of data is cached in memory. After committing or rolling back, the data is placed on the disk, and the lock is released. S Snapshot Isolation (SI) Snapshot Isolation is a multi-version concurrency control approach that is widely used in practice. MatrixOne supports distributed transaction of snapshot isolation level."},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#concepts","title":"Concepts","text":"<p>MatrixOne relies heavily on the following concepts. Being familiar with them will help you understand what our architecture achieves.</p> Term Definition A Auto-Rebalance A modern distributed database should do more than just split data amongst a number of servers. The automatic process of storage and workload distribution among servers is called an Auto-Rebalance. C Consistency MatrixOne supports a strong consistency. It is guaranted that after any successful data write, the reading afterwards will get the latest value, no matter from which store. E Execution Plan An execution plan in a database is a simple graphical representation of the operations that the query optimizer generates to calculate the most efficient way to return a set of results. F Fault-Tolerance Fault-Tolerance simply means a system's ability to continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of one or more of its components. M Monolithic Engine A monolithic database engine is designed to support hybrid workloads: transactional, analytical, streaming, time-series, machine learning, and so on. Materialized View A materialized view is a pre-computed data set derived from a query specification (the SELECT in the view definition) and stored for later use. Materialized view is usually used for increasing performance and efficiency. Metadata Metadata is the data that describes the structure and creation method of data in a database. P Paxos Paxos is an algorithm that is used to achieve consensus among a distributed set of computers that communicate via an asynchronous network. R Raft Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. Raft Group and Leader Raft defines a strong, single leader and number of followers in a group of peers. The group represents a replicated state machine. Only the leader may service client requests. The leader replicates actions to the followers. S SIMD instruction SIMD is short for Single Instruction/Multiple Data, while the term SIMD operations refers to a computing method that enables processing of multiple data with a single instruction. T Transaction A set of operations performed on your database that satisfy the requirements of ACID semantics. TAE Transactional Analytic Engine. The storage engine is the main public interface of the storage layer, which can support both row and column storage and transaction processing capabilities. V Vectorized Execution Vectorized data processing helps with developing faster analytical query engines by making efficient utilization of CPU cache. Arrow's columnar format allows to use lightweight schemes like dictionary encoding, bit packing, and run length encoding, which favor query performance over compression ratio."},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/make-your-first-contribution/","title":"Make Your First Contribution","text":"<p>Thank you for your interest in contributing to MatrixOne.

During the subsequent installation of MatrixOne, MatrixOne will communicate with Minio directly through the Kubernetes Service (SVC) without additional configuration.</p> <p>However, if you want to connect to Minio from <code>localhost</code>, you can execute the following command line to set the <code>POD_NAME</code> variable and connect <code>mostorage</code> to port 9000:</p> <pre><code>export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace mostorage -l \"release=minio\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\nnohup kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 $POD_NAME -n mostorage 9000:9000 &amp;\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>After startup, use http://118.195.255.252:32001/ to log in to the MinIO page and create object storage information. As shown in the figure below, the account password is the rootUser and rootPassword set by <code>--set rootUser=rootuser,rootPassword=rootpass123</code> in the above steps:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>After logging in, you need to create object storage related information:</p> <p>Fill in the Bucket Name with minio-mo under Bucket &gt; Create Bucket. After filling it in, click the Create Bucket button at the bottom right.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Deploy/deploy-MatrixOne-cluster/#5-deploying-a-matrixone-cluster","title":"5.

In many standard business environments, such as high-concurrency writes, report generation, backup, and significant data export, traditional database solutions often require the deployment of specific instances to achieve load isolation. This approach also results in an additional burden of data synchronization.</p> <p>MatrixOne uses a Proxy to implement resource group division, which can flexibly combine CN groups with user-specified load labels. In the event of load changes, MatrixOne can adjust the scale of the resource group through software configuration, thus better adapting to changes.</p> <p>Using the above example, you can set the load labels of two CNs to <code>olap</code> and <code>oltp</code>, respectively. Then, use SSB to simulate the OLTP load and TPCH to simulate the OLAP load.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When performing performance testing, you must first scale out the entire cluster.</p> <pre><code>metadata:\n  name: mo\n  namespace: mo-hn\nspec:\n+ cnGroups:\n+ - name: cn-set1\n+   replicas: 1\n+   cnLabels:\n+   - key: \"workload\"\n+     # The load label is set to olap\n+     values: [\"olap\"]\n+\n+ - name: cn-set2\n+   replicas: 1\n+   cnLabels:\n+   - key: \"workload\"\n+     # The load label is set to oltp\n+           values: [\"oltp\"]\n</code></pre> <p>After configuring the load of the cluster, you can connect to the cluster for load testing:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Connect via JDBC:</p> <p>Specify connection attributes in the JDBC connection string, and set the corresponding key and value.

It provides stable and efficient data synchronization functions to achieve efficient data synchronization between various heterogeneous data sources.</p> <p>DataX divides the synchronization of different data sources into two main components: Reader (read data source) and Writer (write to the target data source). The DataX framework theoretically supports data synchronization work for any data source type.</p> <p>MatrixOne is highly compatible with MySQL 8.0. However, since the MySQL Writer plugin with DataX is adapted to the MySQL 5.1 JDBC driver, the community has separately modified the MatrixOneWriter plugin based on the MySQL 8.0 driver to improve compatibility. The MatrixOneWriter plugin implements the functionality of writing data to the target table in the MatrixOne database. In the underlying implementation, MatrixOneWriter connects to the remote MatrixOne database via JDBC and executes the corresponding <code>insert into ...</code> SQL statements to write data to MatrixOne. It also supports batch commits for performance optimization.</p> <p>MatrixOneWriter uses DataX to retrieve generated protocol data from the Reader and generates the corresponding <code>insert into ...</code> statements based on your configured <code>writeMode</code>. In the event of primary key or uniqueness index conflicts, conflicting rows are excluded, and writing continues. For performance optimization, we use the <code>PreparedStatement + Batch</code> method and set the <code>rewriteBatchedStatements=true</code> option to buffer data to the thread context buffer.

See the config documentation for more details\nlistener.security.protocol.map=CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL\n\n# The number of threads that the server uses for receiving requests from the network and sending responses to the network\nnum.network.threads=3\n\n# The number of threads that the server uses for processing requests, which may include disk I/O\nnum.io.threads=8\n\n# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server\nsocket.send.buffer.bytes=102400\n\n# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server\nsocket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400\n\n# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)\nsocket.request.max.bytes=104857600\n\n\n############################# Log Basics #############################\n\n# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files\nlog.dirs=/home/software/kafka_2.13-3.5.0/kraft-combined-logs\n\n# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater\n# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across\n# the brokers.\nnum.partitions=1\n\n# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.\n# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.\nnum.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=1\n\n############################# Internal Topic Settings  #############################\n# The replication factor for the group metadata internal topics \"__consumer_offsets\" and \"__transaction_state\"\n# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended to ensure availability such as 3.\noffsets.topic.replication.factor=1\ntransaction.state.log.replication.factor=1\ntransaction.state.log.min.isr=1\n\n############################# Log Flush Policy #############################\n\n# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync\n# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.\n# There are a few important trade-offs here:\n#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.\n#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.\n#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.\n# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or\n# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.\n\n# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk\n#log.flush.interval.messages=10000\n\n# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush\n#log.flush.interval.ms=1000\n\n############################# Log Retention Policy #############################\n\n# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can\n# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.\n# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens\n# from the end of the log.\n\n# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age\nlog.retention.hours=72\n\n# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining\n# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.\n#log.retention.bytes=1073741824\n\n# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.\nlog.segment.bytes=1073741824\n\n# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according\n# to the retention policies\nlog.retention.check.interval.ms=300000\n</code></pre> <p>After the file configuration is completed, execute the following command to start the Kafka service:</p> <pre><code>#Generate cluster ID\n$ KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID=\"$(bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid)\"\n#Set log directory format\n$ bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t $KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID -c config/kraft/server.properties\n#Start Kafka service\n$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Ecological-Tools/Computing-Engine/Flink/#step-2-create-a-kafka-topic","title":"Step 2: Create a Kafka Topic","text":"<p>To enable Flink to read data from and write data to MatrixOne, we first need to create a Kafka topic named \"matrixone.\" In the command below, use the <code>--bootstrap-server</code> parameter to specify the Kafka service's listening address as <code>192.168.146.12:9092</code>:</p> <pre><code>$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic matrixone --bootstrap-server 192.168.146.12:9092\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/Ecological-Tools/Computing-Engine/Flink/#step-3-read-matrixone-data","title":"Step 3: Read MatrixOne Data","text":"<p>After connecting to the MatrixOne database, perform the following steps to create the necessary database and tables:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a database, and tables and import data in MatrixOne:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE `users` (\n`id` INT DEFAULT NULL,\n`name` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,\n`age` INT DEFAULT NULL\n)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Write code in the IDEA integrated development environment:</p> <p>In IDEA, create two classes: <code>User.java</code> and <code>Kafka2Mo.java</code>.

In addition, the notification of business events can also be recognized through the publish and subscribe function, such as an order being canceled, a certain inventory quantity is insufficient, and so on.</p> <p>There can be a many-to-many relationship between publishers and subscribers; one publisher can publish messages to multiple subscribers, and one subscriber can also subscribe to various messages/data.

At this time, the transaction becomes very important; it can make the system data out of this inconsistent state.</p> <p>How to understand transaction? For example, in the banking system, if there is no transaction to control and manage the data, A likely withdraws a sum of money from the corporate account, and B and C also withdraw money from the same corporate account. Each transfer involves at least two changes in account information (for example, A's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; B's money arrives, and the company's account goes out; C's money comes, and the company's account goes out), If there are no transactions, then the exact value of the booking amount cannot be determined. After introducing the business requirement of the transaction, the essential characteristics of the transaction (ACID) ensure that the fund operation of the bank book is atomic (indivisible) and the amount seen by others is isolated.

The database system usually uses a locking mechanism or a multi-version concurrency control mechanism to obtain a higher isolation level. Application software also requires additional logic to make it work properly.</p> <p>Many database management systems (DBMS) define different \"transaction isolation levels\" to control the degree of locking. In many database systems, most transactions avoid high-level isolation levels (such as serializability) to reduce locking overhead. Programmers must carefully analyze the database access part of the code to ensure that lowering the isolation level does not cause hard-to-find code bugs. On the contrary, a higher isolation level will increase the chance of deadlock, which must be avoided during programming.</p> <p>The DBMS is allowed to use a higher isolation level than the one requested because there are no operations in a higher isolation level that are prohibited by a lower isolation level.</p> <p>ANSI/ISO SQL defines four standard isolation levels:</p> Isolation Level Dirty Write Dirty Read Fuzzy Read Phantom READ UNCOMMITTED Not Possible Possible Possible Possible READ COMMITTED Not Possible Not Possible Possible Possible REPEATABLE READ Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Possible SERIALIZABLE Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible <ul> <li> <p>READ UNCOMMITTED: READ UNCOMMITTED is the lowest isolation level. \"Dirty reads\" are allowed, and transactions can see the \"not committed\" modifications of other transactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>READ COMMITTED: At the READ COMMITTED level, the DBMS based on lock mechanism concurrency control needs to keep the write lock on the selected object until the end of the transaction, but the read lock is released immediately after the SELECT operation is completed.

MatrixOne has implemented Snapshot Isolation and it is also known as REPEATABLE READS to maintain consistency with the isolation level in MySQL.</p> </li> <li> <p>SERIALIZABLE: SERIALIZABLE is the highest isolation level.

Finally, it applies the modifications to the Tuple in the newly allocated Slot. The critical decision of the Append Only mechanism is how to order the version chain of Tuple.

Basically, JSONL is a file format that allows one JSON object per line with lines delimited by a newline character <code>\\n</code>.  Each line of the file is independent, so commas are not required at the beginning or ending of lines.  Nor does the entire contents of the file need to be enclosed in square or curly braces.</p> <p>JSONLines is appealing format for data streaming.

One is the object storage shared by the entire MatrixOne distributed cluster, which is the primary storage device of the cluster. The other is the local storage on each compute node (CN), mainly used for data caching. The primary storage contains all data of the entire cluster, while the cache only saves data extracted from the primary storage during recent queries. In addition, the memory of CN nodes is also used as part of the data cache.</p> <p></p> <p>When a user initiates a query, the system first checks whether the cache of the CN to which the user is connected already contains the required data. If it exists, the system directly returns the result to the user, prioritizing memory over disk. Suppose the required data is not found in the cache of the currently connected CN. In that case, the system queries the global metadata information to see if the required data exists in the cache of other available CNs for this user, checking memory first and then disk. If it exists, the system redirects the request to the CN containing this data, processes it, and returns the result to the user. If the data searched for is not in the cache of any available CN, the system initiates a read request to the object storage and returns the result to the user.</p> <p></p> <p>When a user queries data from object storage, the queried data block will be filled into the corresponding position according to the cache query order. For example, if a user queries 100M of data from object storage, this 100M of data will first be written into the memory of the CN node to which the user is connected and then written into the disk cache of this CN node. Each time a new query is generated, the data in the cache will be updated according to this rule. Whether in memory or disk, data replacement in the CN cache follows the LRU (Least Recently Used) principle. With this mechanism, the most recent data is always in the easiest-to-get position, while relatively unpopular data will gradually be removed from the cache.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-cold-hot-data-separation/#product-features","title":"Product Features","text":"<p>The features of data caching and hot-cold data separation bring unique advantages to the product.

Additionally, TAE can support large or long-running transactions.</p> <p>The format of the log entry header in TAE's redo log follows the structure below:</p> Item Byte Size GroupID 4 LSN 8 Length 8 Type 1 <p>The transaction log entries include the following types:</p> Type Data Type Value Description AC int8 0x10 Full write operations of a committed transaction PC int8 0x11 Partial write operations of a committed transaction UC int8 0x12 Partial write operations of an uncommitted transaction RB int8 0x13 Transaction rollback CKP int8 0x40 Checkpoint <p>Most transactions have only one log entry, but larger or longer transactions may require multiple entries. Therefore, a transaction's log may contain one or more UC-type log entries, one PC-type log entry, or just one AC-type log entry. UC-type log entries are allocated to a dedicated group.</p> <p>In TAE, the payload of a transaction log entry contains multiple transaction nodes. Transaction nodes include data manipulation language (DML) operations such as delete, add, update, and data definition language (DDL) operations such as create/delete table, create/delete database, etc. Each transaction node is a sub-item of a committed log entry and can be understood as part of the transaction log. Active transaction nodes share a fixed-size memory space and are managed by the cache manager. When there is insufficient space, some transaction nodes are unloaded, and their corresponding log entries are saved in the redo log. These log entries are replayed and applied to their respective transaction nodes during loading.</p> <p>A checkpoint is a safe point where the state machine can apply log entries during a system restart. Log entries before the checkpoint are no longer needed and will be physically destroyed at the appropriate time. TAE records information about the last checkpoint through groups, allowing log replay to start from the last checkpoint during system restart.</p> <p>TAE's WAL and log replay components have been independently abstracted into a code module called log store. It provides an abstraction for low-level log storage and access operations, which can be adapted to different implementations ranging from single-node to distributed systems. At the physical level, the behavior of a store is similar to that of a message queue. Starting from version 0.6 of MatrixOne, we have evolved towards a cloud-native version, using a separate shared log service as the log service. Therefore, in future versions, TAE's log store will be appropriately modified to access the external shared log service directly, eliminating the dependency on local storage.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-tae/#transaction-processing","title":"Transaction Processing","text":"<p>TAE ensures transaction isolation by employing the Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) mechanism. Each transaction is equipped with a consistent read view determined by the transaction's start time, ensuring that the data read within the transaction never reflects modifications made by other concurrent transactions. TAE provides fine-grained optimistic concurrency control, and conflicts occur only when updates are made to the same row and column. Transactions use value versions that existed at the start of the transaction and do not lock them during read operations. When two transactions attempt to update the same value, the second fails due to a write-write conflict.</p> <p>In TAE's architecture, a table consists of multiple segments, each resulting from multiple transactions. Therefore, a segment can be represented as <code>$[T{start}, T{end}]$</code> (\u00b7 is the commit time of the earliest transaction, \u00b7 is the commit time of the latest transaction). To compress and merge segments, an additional dimension is added to the representation of a segment: <code>$([T{start} T{end}]$</code>, <code>[T{create}, T{drop}])$</code> where <code>$T{create}$</code> is the creation time of the segment and <code>$T{drop}$</code> is the deletion time of the segment. When <code>$T{drop} = 0$</code>, it indicates that the segment has not been dropped. The representation of blocks is the same as that of segments: <code>$([T{start}, T{end}]$</code>, <code>[T{create}, T{drop}])$</code>. When a transaction is committed, its read view is determined by the commit time: <code>$(Txn{commit} \\geqslant T{create}) \\bigcap ((T{drop} = 0) \\bigcup (T{drop} &gt; Txn{commit}))$</code>.</p> <p>Background asynchronous tasks handle the generation and transformation of segments. To ensure data consistency during data reading, TAE incorporates these asynchronous tasks into the transaction processing framework, as shown in the example below:</p> <p></p> <p>Block <code>$Block1 {L0}$</code> in layer L0 is created at time <code>$t1$</code> and contains data from <code>$Txn1$</code>, <code>$Txn2$</code>, <code>$Txn3$</code>, and <code>$Txn4$</code>. Block <code>$Block1 {L0}$</code> starts sorting at <code>$t11$</code>; its read view is the baseline plus one uncommitted update node. Sorting and persisting blocks may take a long time. Before the committed sorted block <code>$Block2 {L1}$</code> is flushed, there are two committed transactions <code>$Txn5$</code>, <code>$Txn6$</code>, and one uncommitted transaction <code>$Txn7$</code>. When <code>$Txn7$</code> is committed at <code>$t16$</code>, it fails because <code>$Block1 {L0}$</code> has already been terminated. The update nodes <code>$Txn5$</code> and <code>$Txn6$</code> committed during the period <code>$(t11, t16)$</code> will be merged into a new update node, which will be committed together with <code>$Block2 {L1}$</code> at `$t16</p> <p>$`.</p> <p></p> <p>The compaction process terminates a series of blocks or segments and atomically creates a new block or segment (or builds an index). Unlike regular transactions, this process often takes longer, and we do not want to block, update, or delete transactions involving the blocks or segments in question. Therefore, we extend the read view to include the metadata of blocks and segments. During the execution of a transaction, each write operation checks for write-write conflicts. If a conflict occurs, the transaction is terminated prematurely.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/architecture/architecture-tae/#mvcc-multi-version-concurrency-control","title":"MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)","text":"<p>The version storage mechanism of a database determines how the system stores different versions of tuples and the information contained in each version. TAE creates a lock-free linked list called the version chain based on the pointer fields of data tuples. The version chain allows the database to locate the desired version of a tuple accurately. Therefore, the storage mechanism for version data is an essential consideration in the design of a database storage engine.</p> <p>One solution is to use an append-only mechanism to store all tuple versions of a table in the same storage space. Due to the inability to maintain a lock-free bidirectional linked list, the version chain can only point in one direction: from old to new (O2N) or from new to old (N2O).</p> <p>Another similar solution is time travel, which keeps the information of the version chain separate while maintaining the primary version of tuples in the main table.</p> <p>The third solution is to maintain the primary version of tuples in the main table and a series of incremental versions in separate storage. When updating existing tuples, the database acquires a continuous space from the incremental storage to create a new incremental version that only contains the original values of the modified attributes rather than the entire tuple. The database then directly updates the primary version in the main table.</p> <p>Each of the above solutions has characteristics that impact its performance in OLTP workloads.

MatrixOne can support OLTP and OLAP in the same cluster, achieving Hybrid Transaction and Analytical Processing (HTAP). Users no longer need to build two separate database systems for OLTP and OLAP, a single database can support mixed loads. This avoids the cost of building and maintaining two systems and the ETL process of synchronizing data from the OLTP system to the OLAP system.

Although the conversion process between the two storage engines is hidden from the user, who only sees a unified SQL interface, the data is stored twice, once in each machine, and the cost of hardware and storage is not reduced.</p> <p>Different from the engine mentioned above encapsulation method, MatrixOne achieves HTAP using a single storage engine. As shown below, MatrixOne achieves single-engine HTAP by grouping other computing nodes (CN) and distinguishing between load-running links. When a user's application request enters the MatrixOne cluster, the Proxy module distributes OLAP-like requests to the CN group designed explicitly for OLAP. These requests usually need to read or write data on a large scale and interact directly with object storage via the CN nodes. For OLTP-like requests, such as small amounts of <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>, these go through another group of CN designed explicitly for OLTP, and the TN nodes handle transaction information and write shared logs to LogService. TN also constantly compresses and merges small transactional data from LogService and writes them back to object storage.</p> <p>In summary, the data written into MatrixOne by users only exists once and is processed by a single storage engine, significantly reducing the cost of storage and computing hardware.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/cost-effective/#flexible-resource-allocation-increases-utilization","title":"Flexible Resource Allocation Increases Utilization","text":"<p>The system primarily serves transactional business based on CRUD in actual data application business scenarios. However, at specific points in time, such as at night, at the end of the month, or at the end of the year, it is necessary to analyze the overall data over a period of time. At this time, if the user only has one database system, they will need to temporarily reduce the business load or conduct OLAP analytical tasks when the business load is low. However, in such cases, there are often problems like long analysis time and cannot affect the long running time of business. If users deploy a separate database system for OLAP analytical business, the actual analytical business is often difficult to maximize, leading to a specific waste of resources.</p> <p>As introduced in the previous section, MatrixOne achieves HTAP by grouping stateless computing nodes and supporting OLTP and OLAP business at the underlying layer through different links. This architecture allows MatrixOne to adjust resources flexibly.</p> <p>Allocation according to actual business needs increases machine utilization and achieves true cost-effectiveness. When CRUD-type business requirements are high, you can allocate more CN nodes to OLTP. In addition, when analytical business requirements increase, you can give more CN nodes to OLAP. These adjustments are fully dynamic and configurable.</p> <p>Take the following diagram as an example; suppose that the user needs 3 computing nodes to handle OLTP business and 3 computing nodes to handle OLAP business. And these hardware resources are fully bound, i.e., nodes serving OLTP cannot provide services for OLAP and vice versa. Moreover, users' planning for machine resources often exceeds the upper limit of actual demand. However, the time to reach the total peak demand is quite limited in real business. If you plan to use the MatrixOne cluster to support these businesses, you can adjust to 4 computing nodes; typically, 3 nodes handle OLTP business, and 1 node takes OLAP business. Then, at the end of the month or other periods when the demand for analysis is high, you can adjust to 1 computing node to handle the OLTP business and 3 computing nodes to run the OLAP business; after the peak period, you can return to the original configuration, thereby improving machine resource utilization by 40%.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Overview/feature/cost-effective/#efficient-and-low-cost-object-storage","title":"Efficient and Low-Cost Object Storage","text":"<p>At the storage level, MatrixOne mainly uses object storage.

The separation of the storage, transaction, and computing layers allows MatrixOne to expand nodes when encountering system resource bottlenecks flexibly. The storage layer is mainly based on object storage and partly based on the cache on the computing nodes (CN). The transaction layer is based on stateless transaction nodes (TN). The computing layer is based on stateless computing nodes (CN). The multi-node architecture can more effectively distribute resources and avoid hot spots and resource contention.</p> </li> <li> <p>Infinite Expansion Capability of S3 Object Storage: The core storage of MatrixOne is completely based on S3 object storage. S3 object storage has naturally high availability and infinite scalability, making MatrixOne highly scalable in data storage. No matter how the data scale grows, MatrixOne can meet the demand by expanding S3 storage. In a private deployment environment, MatrixOne builds S3 services based on the open-source MinIO component. MatrixOne can seamlessly utilize the object storage service provided by the public cloud in a public cloud environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stateless Computing and Transaction Nodes: MatrixOne's computing nodes (CN) and transaction nodes (TN) are stateless, meaning they can be horizontally expanded anytime. Stateless design means that computing and transaction nodes do not need to store any persistent data</p> </li> </ul> <p>They can be easily added or deleted to cope with different load requirements. This design makes MatrixOne extremely scalable and flexible when dealing with large-scale concurrent requests. (The current 1.0 version TN node does not yet have expansion capabilities, but the TN mainly handles transaction submission information, and the load is lower, so a single TN is enough to take a large-scale cluster, and subsequent versions will improve TN's scalability.)</p> <ul> <li>Independent Scaling for Different Workloads and Accounts: MatrixOne utilizes the Proxy module to group multiple compute nodes (CN) into managed sets known as CN Sets, achieved through labeling. This enables the independent scaling of each CN Set. Users can assign different CN Sets to distinct tenants, ensuring load isolation and separate scaling between tenants. It's also possible to give various CN Sets to diverse workloads, such as read and write workloads, or transactional and analytical workloads, thereby achieving isolation and separate scaling between them.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Performance-Tuning/performance-tuning-overview/","title":"SQL Performance Tuning Methods Overview","text":"<p>SQL performance tuning optimizes database queries and operations to improve performance and response time. Several standard performance tuning methods include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Index optimization: Indexes can speed up queries and improve database performance.

Therefore, the resource size of the CN node is proportional to the computing power. The most direct expansion method is to expand the resources of a single CN node vertically. At the same time, the queried data is stored in the CN cache as hot data. If the cache is hit, the query can be returned directly from the cache without obtaining cold data from the object store. After the upper capacity limit is exceeded, the cache will only replace the data with the LRU algorithm, so the cache size is also helpful for improving performance.</p> <p>In addition, we can also improve performance by horizontally expanding CN nodes. The horizontal expansion has two technical characteristics that can improve performance. First, multiple user connection requests can be dispersed to different CN nodes, spreading the load on each CN. Secondly, other CN nodes also have different caches. When the CN node that receives the query request finds that the request data is not in its cache, it will find the CN node containing the request data cache through the metadata and forward the request to it for processing to improve the cache hit rate.</p> <p>The expansion of the MatrixOne distributed cluster components can be done through the Operator. For the operation method, please look at the expansion and contraction chapter of the MatrixOne cluster.

The DEFAULT clause also can be used to specify a constant (nonautomatic) default value (for example, DEFAULT 0 or DEFAULT '2000-01-01 00:00:00').</p> <p><code>TIMESTAMP</code> or <code>DATETIME</code> column definitions can specify the current timestamp for both the default and auto-update values, for one but not the other, or for neither. Different columns can have different combinations of automatic properties. The following rules describe the possibilities:</p> <ul> <li>With both <code>DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code> and <code>ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code>, the column has the current timestamp for its default value and is automatically updated to the current timestamp.</li> </ul> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (\n  ts TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  dt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>With a <code>DEFAULT</code> clause but no <code>ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code> clause, the column has the given default value and is not automatically updated to the current timestamp.</li> </ul> <p>The default depends on whether the DEFAULT clause specifies CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or a constant value. With CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, the default is the current timestamp.</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (\n  ts TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  dt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n</code></pre> <p>With a constant, the default is the given value. In this case, the column has no automatic properties at all.</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (\n  ts TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 0,\n  dt DATETIME DEFAULT 0\n);\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>With an <code>ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code> clause and a constant <code>DEFAULT</code> clause, the column is automatically updated to the current timestamp and has the given constant default value.</li> </ul> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (\n  ts TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 0 ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  dt DATETIME DEFAULT 0 ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>With an <code>ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code> clause but no DEFAULT clause, the column is automatically updated to the current timestamp but does not have the current timestamp for its default value.</li> </ul> <p>The default in this case is type dependent. TIMESTAMP has a default of 0 unless defined with the NULL attribute, in which case the default is NULL.</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (\n  ts1 TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,     -- default 0\n  ts2 TIMESTAMP NULL ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- default NULL\n);\n</code></pre> <p><code>DATETIME</code> has a default of NULL unless defined with the NOT NULL attribute, in which case the default is 0.</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (\n  dt1 DATETIME ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,         -- default NULL\n  dt2 DATETIME NOT NULL ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- default 0\n);\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Data-Types/date-time-data-types/year-type/","title":"YEAR Type","text":"<p>The YEAR type is a 1-byte data type used to represent year values.

Here are some common use cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data Validation: Regular expressions can validate whether data complies with a specific format, such as checking whether a field contains a valid email address, phone number, or social security number. For example, you can use a regular expression to find all email addresses that do not conform to the standard format:</p> <pre><code>SELECT email\nFROM users\nWHERE email NOT REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$';\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Data Filtering: Regular expressions can be used to search for data that contains or does not contain specific patterns. For example, if you want to find all phone numbers that start with a specific prefix, you can use a regular expression to match these numbers:</p> <pre><code>SELECT phone_number\nFROM users\nWHERE phone_number REGEXP '^180';\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Data Cleaning: Regular expressions are also instrumental in data cleaning. For example, you may need to clear special characters and spaces or extract numbers from strings; regular expressions can quickly implement these functions:</p> <pre><code>SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(name, '[^a-zA-Z]', '')\nFROM users;\n</code></pre> <p>This SQL will return the result of all non-alphabetical characters in the name field being replaced.</p> </li> <li> <p>Text Analysis: If you are conducting text analysis, regular expressions can help you find specific words or phrases in the text and can even be used for certain forms of natural language processing.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Functions-and-Operators/String/Regular-Expressions/Regular-Expression-Functions-Overview/#special-characters","title":"Special Characters","text":"<p>Regular expressions use POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) extended regular expressions.

An <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column works properly only if it contains only positive values. Inserting a negative number is regarded as inserting a very large positive number. This is done to avoid precision problems when numbers \"wrap\" over from positive to negative and also to ensure that you do not accidentally get an <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column that contains 0.</p> <p>You can use the <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> attribute to define the starting value of an auto-increment column. If you want to set the starting value of the auto-increment column to 10, you can use the <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> keyword when creating the table and specify the starting value later.</p> <p>For example, to create a table and define an auto-increment column with a starting value of 10, you can use the following SQL statement:</p> <pre><code>-- set up\ncreate table t1(a int auto_increment primary key) auto_increment = 10;\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the <code>id</code> column is an auto-incrementing column with a starting value 10. When a new record is inserted into the table, the value of the <code>id</code> column will start from 10 and increment by 1 each time. If the starting value of <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> is not specified, the default starting value is 1, which is automatically incremented by 1 each time.</p> <p>Note</p> <ol> <li>MatrixOne currently only supports the default increment step size of 1; regardless of the initial value of the auto-increment column, each auto-increment is 1. Temporarily does not support setting the incremental step size.</li> <li>MatrixOne only syntax supports using the system variable <code>set @@auto_increment_offset=n</code> to set the initial value of the auto-increment column, but it does not take effect.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/1.1-create-table/#primary-key","title":"PRIMARY KEY","text":"<p>The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.</p> <p>Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.</p> <p>A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single column (field).</p> <ul> <li>SQL PRIMARY KEY on CREATE TABLE</li> </ul> <p>The following SQL creates a PRIMARY KEY on the \"ID\" column when the \"Persons\" table is created:</p> <pre><code>&gt; CREATE TABLE Persons (\n    ID int NOT NULL,\n    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,\n    FirstName varchar(255),\n    Age int,\n    PRIMARY KEY (ID)\n);\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Language/1.1-create-table/#foreign-key","title":"FOREIGN KEY","text":"<p>The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.</p> <p>A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.</p> <p>The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.</p> <p>The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.</p> <p>When defining FOREIGN KEY, the following rules need to be followed:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The parent table must already exist in the database or be a table currently being created.

These two parameters are primarily used to maintain data integrity and consistency:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>ON DELETE reference_option</code>: This parameter specifies how to handle associated foreign key data when data in the referenced table is deleted. Common options include:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>RESTRICT</code>: If related foreign key data exists in the referenced table, deletion of data in the table is not allowed. This prevents accidental deletion of related data, ensuring data consistency.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>CASCADE</code>: When data in the referenced table is deleted, associated foreign key data is also deleted. This is used for cascading deletion of related data to maintain data integrity.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>SET NULL</code>: When data in the referenced table is deleted, the value of the foreign key column is set to NULL. This is used to retain foreign key data while disconnecting it from the referenced data upon deletion.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>NO ACTION</code>: Indicates no action is taken; it only checks for the existence of associated data. This is similar to <code>RESTRICT</code> but may have minor differences in some databases.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>ON UPDATE reference_option</code>: This parameter specifies how to handle associated foreign key data when data in the referenced table is updated. Common options are similar to those of <code>ON DELETE reference_option</code>, and their usage is identical, but they apply to data update operations.</p> </li> </ul> <p>See the example below:</p> <p>Suppose there are two tables, <code>Orders</code> and <code>Customers</code>, where the <code>Orders</code> table has a foreign key column <code>customer_id</code> referencing the <code>id</code> column in the <code>Customers</code> table.

This has the same effect as with tables that are partitioned by <code>HASH</code>. This example uses linear partitioning by <code>key</code> to distribute data between 5 partitions:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE tk (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATE)\n    PARTITION BY LINEAR KEY(col3)\n    PARTITIONS 5;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>RANGE(expr)</li> </ul> <p>In this case, expr shows a range of values using a set of <code>VALUES LESS THAN</code> operators.

VALUES LESS THAN ...</code> statements work in a consecutive fashion. <code>VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE</code> works to specify \"leftover\" values that are greater than the maximum value otherwise specified.</p> <p>The clauses must be arranged in such a way that the upper limit specified in each successive <code>VALUES LESS THAN</code> is greater than that of the previous one, with the one referencing <code>MAXVALUE</code> coming last of all in the list.</p> <ul> <li>RANGE COLUMNS(column_list)</li> </ul> <p>This variant on <code>RANGE</code> facilitates partition pruning for queries using range conditions on multiple columns (that is, having conditions such as <code>WHERE a = 1 AND b &lt; 10 or WHERE a = 1 AND b = 10 AND c &lt; 10)</code>. It enables you to specify value ranges in multiple columns by using a list of columns in the COLUMNS clause and a set of column values in each <code>PARTITION ... VALUES LESS THAN (value_list)</code> partition definition clause. (In the simplest case, this set consists of a single column.) The maximum number of columns that can be referenced in the column_list and value_list is 16.</p> <p>The column_list used in the <code>COLUMNS</code> clause may contain only names of columns; each column in the list must be one of the following MySQL data types: the integer types; the string types; and time or date column types. Columns using BLOB, TEXT, SET, ENUM, BIT, or spatial data types are not permitted; columns that use floating-point number types are also not permitted. You also may not use functions or arithmetic expressions in the <code>COLUMNS</code> clause.</p> <p>The <code>VALUES LESS THAN</code> clause used in a partition definition must specify a literal value for each column that appears in the COLUMNS() clause; that is, the list of values used for each <code>VALUES LESS THAN</code> clause must contain the same number of values as there are columns listed in the <code>COLUMNS</code> clause. An attempt to use more or fewer values in a <code>VALUES LESS THAN</code> clause than there are in the COLUMNS clause causes the statement to fail with the error Inconsistency in usage of column lists for partitioning.... You cannot use <code>NULL</code> for any value appearing in <code>VALUES LESS THAN</code>. It is possible to use MAXVALUE more than once for a given column other than the first, as shown in this example:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE rc (\n    a INT NOT NULL,\n    b INT NOT NULL\n)\nPARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(a,b) (\n    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10,5),\n    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (20,10),\n    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (50,MAXVALUE),\n    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (65,MAXVALUE),\n    PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE)\n);\n</code></pre> <p>Each value used in a <code>VALUES LESS THAN</code> value list must match the type of the corresponding column exactly; no conversion is made. For example, you cannot use the string '1' for a value that matches a column that uses an integer type (you must use the numeral 1 instead), nor can you use the numeral 1 for a value that matches a column that uses a string type (in such a case, you must use a quoted string: '1').</p> <ul> <li>LIST(expr)</li> </ul> <p>This is useful when assigning partitions based on a table column with a restricted set of possible values, such as a state or country code. In such a case, all rows pertaining to a certain state or country can be assigned to a single partition, or a partition can be reserved for a certain set of states or countries. It is similar to RANGE, except that only VALUES IN may be used to specify permissible values for each partition.</p> <p><code>VALUES IN</code> is used with a list of values to be matched. For instance, you could create a partitioning scheme such as the following:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE client_firms (\n    id   INT,\n    name VARCHAR(35)\n)\nPARTITION BY LIST (id) (\n    PARTITION r0 VALUES IN (1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21),\n    PARTITION r1 VALUES IN (2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22),\n    PARTITION r2 VALUES IN (3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23),\n    PARTITION r3 VALUES IN (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)\n);\n</code></pre> <p>When using list partitioning, you must define at least one partition using VALUES IN. You cannot use VALUES LESS THAN with PARTITION BY LIST.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For tables partitioned by LIST, the value list used with VALUES IN must consist of integer values only. In MySQL 8.0, you can overcome this limitation using partitioning by LIST COLUMNS, which is described later in this section.</p> <ul> <li>LIST COLUMNS(column_list)</li> </ul> <p>This variant on <code>LIST</code> facilitates partition pruning for queries using comparison conditions on multiple columns (that is, having conditions such as <code>WHERE a = 5 AND b = 5 or WHERE a = 1 AND b = 10 AND c = 5</code>). It enables you to specify values in multiple columns by using a list of columns in the COLUMNS clause and a set of column values in each <code>PARTITION ... VALUES IN</code> (value_list) partition definition clause.</p> <p>The rules governing regarding data types for the column list used in <code>LIST COLUMNS(column_list)</code> and the value list used in <code>VALUES IN(value_list)</code> are the same as those for the column list used in <code>RANGE COLUMNS(column_list)</code> and the value list used in <code>VALUES LESS THAN(value_list)</code>, respectively, except that in the <code>VALUES IN</code> clause, <code>MAXVALUE</code> is not permitted, and you may use <code>NULL</code>.</p> <p>There is one important difference between the list of values used for VALUES IN with <code>PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS</code> as opposed to when it is used with <code>PARTITION BY LIST</code>. When used with <code>PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS</code>, each element in the <code>VALUES IN</code> clause must be a set of column values; the number of values in each set must be the same as the number of columns used in the <code>COLUMNS</code> clause, and the data types of these values must match those of the columns (and occur in the same order). In the simplest case, the set consists of a single column. The maximum number of columns that can be used in the column_list and in the elements making up the value_list is 16.</p> <p>The table defined by the following <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement provides an example of a table using <code>LIST COLUMNS</code> partitioning:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE lc (\n    a INT NULL,\n    b INT NULL\n)\nPARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(a,b) (\n    PARTITION p0 VALUES IN( (0,0), (NULL,NULL) ),\n    PARTITION p1 VALUES IN( (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2) ),\n    PARTITION p2 VALUES IN( (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1) ),\n    PARTITION p3 VALUES IN( (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) )\n);\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>PARTITIONS num</li> </ul> <p>The number of partitions may optionally be specified with a PARTITIONS num clause, where num is the number of partitions.

Typically this is value+1, where the value is the largest value for the column currently in the table. <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> sequences begin with 1 default.</p> <p>There can be only one <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column per table, which must be indexed and cannot have a DEFAULT value. An <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column works properly only if it contains only positive values. Inserting a negative number is regarded as inserting a very large positive number.

This is used to retain foreign key data while disconnecting it from the referenced data upon deletion.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>NO ACTION</code>: Indicates no action is taken; it only checks for the existence of associated data. This is similar to <code>RESTRICT</code> but may have minor differences in some databases.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>ON UPDATE reference_option</code>: This parameter specifies how to handle associated foreign key data when data in the referenced table is updated. Common options are similar to those of <code>ON DELETE reference_option</code>, and their usage is identical, but they apply to data update operations.</p> </li> </ul> <p>See the example below:</p> <p>Suppose there are two tables, <code>Orders</code> and <code>Customers</code>, where the <code>Orders</code> table has a foreign key column <code>customer_id</code> referencing the <code>id</code> column in the <code>Customers</code> table.

The execution plan shows how the table(s) referenced by the statement will be scanned \u2014 by plain sequential scan, index scan, and so on. \u2014 and if multiple tables are referenced, what join algorithms will be used to bring together the required rows from each input table.</p> <p>The most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in cost units that are arbitrary, but conventionally mean disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up cost before the first row can be returned, and the total cost to return all the rows. For most queries the total cost is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery in <code>EXISTS</code>, the planner will choose the smallest start-up cost instead of the smallest total cost (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with a <code>LIMIT</code> clause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest.</p> <p>The ANALYZE option causes the statement to be actually executed, not only planned. Then actual run time statistics are added to the display, including the total elapsed time expended within each plan node (in milliseconds) and the total number of rows it actually returned. This is useful for seeing whether the planner's estimates are close to reality.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/Explain/explain/#parameters","title":"Parameters","text":"<ul> <li>ANALYZE:</li> </ul> <p>Carry out the command and show actual run times and other statistics.

If auto-reconnect is enabled, the client is not notified that the connection was lost. For this reason, clients may wish to disable auto-reconnect.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A parameter used in a prepared statement has its type determined when the statement is first prepared, and retains this type whenever <code>EXECUTE</code> is invoked for this prepared statement. Rules for determining a parameter's type are listed here:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a binary arithmetic operator has the same data type as the other operand.</p> </li> <li> <p>If both operands of a binary arithmetic operator are parameters, the type of the parameters is decided by the context of the operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is the operand of a unary arithmetic operator, the parameter's type is decided by the context of the operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>If an arithmetic operator has no type-determining context, the derived type for any parameters involved is <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>. This can happen, for example, when the parameter is a top-level node in a <code>SELECT</code> list, or when it is part of a comparison operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a character string operator has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the other operands. If all operands of the operator are parameters, the derived type is <code>VARCHAR;</code> its collation is determined by the value of <code>collation_connection</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a temporal operator has type DATETIME if the operator returns a <code>DATETIME</code>, <code>TIME</code> if the operator returns a <code>TIME</code>, and <code>DATE</code> if the operator returns a <code>DATE</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is an operand of a binary comparison operator has the same derived type as the other operand of the comparison.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter that is an operand of a ternary comparison operator such as <code>BETWEEN</code> has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the other operands.</p> </li> <li> <p>If all operands of a comparison operator are parameters, the derived type for each of them is <code>VARCHAR</code>, with collation determined by the value of <code>collation_connection</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter that is an output operand of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF, IFNULL, or NULLIF has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the operator's other output operands.</p> </li> <li> <p>If all output operands of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF, IFNULL, or NULLIF are parameters, or they are all NULL, the type of the parameter is decided by the context of the operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the parameter is an operand of any of CASE, COALESCE(), IF, or IFNULL, and has no type-determining context, the derived type for each of the parameters involved is VARCHAR, and its collation is determined by the value of collation_connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter which is the operand of a CAST() has the same type as specified by the CAST().</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is not part of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is VARCHAR, and its collation is determined by the value of collation_connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is part of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type of the corresponding column into which the parameter is inserted.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is used as source for an assignment in a SET clause of an UPDATE statement or in the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type of the corresponding column which is updated by the SET or ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a parameter is an argument of a function, the derived type depends on the function's return type.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For some combinations of actual type and derived type, an automatic repreparation of the statement is triggered. Repreparation does not occur if any of the following conditions are true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>NULL is used as the actual parameter value.</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter is an operand of a CAST(). (Instead, a cast to the derived type is attempted, and an exception raised if the cast fails.)</p> </li> <li> <p>A parameter is a string. (In this case, an implicit CAST(? AS derived_type) is performed.)</p> </li> <li> <p>The derived type and actual type of the parameter are both INTEGER and have the same sign.</p> </li> <li> <p>The parameter's derived type is DECIMAL and its actual type is either DECIMAL or INTEGER.</p> </li> <li> <p>The derived type is DOUBLE and the actual type is any numeric type.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both the derived type and the actual type are string types.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the derived type is temporal and the actual type is temporal. Exceptions: The derived type is TIME and the actual type is not TIME; the derived type is DATE and the actual type is not DATE.</p> </li> <li> <p>The derived type is temporal and the actual type is numeric.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For cases other than those just listed, the statement is reprepared and the actual parameter types are used instead of the derived parameter types.</p> <p>These rules also apply to a user variable referenced in a prepared statement.</p> <p>Using a different data type for a given parameter or user variable within a prepared statement for executions of the statement subsequent to the first execution causes the statement to be reprepared. This is less efficient; it may also lead to the parameter's (or variable's) actual type to vary, and thus for results to be inconsistent, with subsequent executions of the prepared statement. For these reasons, it is advisable to use the same data type for a given parameter when re-executing a prepared statement.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/Prepared-Statements/prepare/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>&gt; create table t13 (a int primary key);\n&gt; insert into t13 values (1);\n&gt; select * from t13 where 3 in (select (1+1) union select 1);\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\n&gt; select * from t13 where 3 in (select (1+2) union select 1);\n+------+\n| a    |\n+------+\n|    1 |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\n&gt; prepare st_18492 from 'select * from t13 where 3 in (select (1+1) union select 1)';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; execute st_18492;\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\n\n&gt; prepare st_18493 from 'select * from t13 where 3 in (select (2+1) union select 1)';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; execute st_18493;\n+------+\n| a    |\n+------+\n|    1 |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; deallocate prepare st_18492;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n&gt; deallocate prepare st_18493;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/","title":"SHOW ACCOUNTS","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Lists the meta information and statistics for the accounts created.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#syntax","title":"Syntax","text":"<pre><code>&gt; SHOW ACCOUNTS;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#meta-information-of-account","title":"Meta information of account","text":"Column Name Details Type Date Source ACCOUNT_NAME Account name varchar mo_account ADMIN_NAME The default administrator name is created varchar In the mo_user table under each account CREATED Created time timestamp mo_account STATUS Status, OPEN or SUSPENDED varchar mo_account SUSPENDED_TIME Suspended time timestamp mo_account DB_COUNT the number of databases bigint unsigned mo_tables TABLE_COUNT the number of tables bigint unsigned mo_tables ROW_COUNT Total line number bigint unsigned sum(mo_table_rows()) SIZE Total space used (MB) decimal(29,3) sum(mo_table_size(mt.reldatabase,mt.relname) COMMENT COMMENT information at creation time varchar mo_account"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-account/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>mysql&gt; show accounts;\n+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+\n| account_name | admin_name | created             | status | suspended_time | db_count | table_count | row_count | size  | comment        |\n+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+\n| sys          | root       | 2023-02-14 06:58:15 | open   | NULL           |        8 |          57 |      2681 | 0.351 | system account |\n+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.14 sec)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-collation/","title":"SHOW COLLATION","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-collation/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>This statement lists collations supported by MatrixOne.

Seq_in_index The column sequence number in the index, starting with 1. Column_name The column name. See also the description for the Expression column. Collation How the column is sorted in the index. This can have values A (ascending), D (descending), or NULL (not sorted). Cardinality An estimate of the number of unique values in the index. To update this number, run ANALYZE TABLE or (for MyISAM tables) myisamchk -a.Cardinality is counted based on statistics stored as integers, so the value is not necessarily exact even for small tables. The higher the cardinality, the greater the chance that MySQL uses the index when doing joins. Sub_part The index prefix. That is, the number of indexed characters if the column is only partly indexed, NULL if the entire column is indexed.  Note: Prefix limits are measured in bytes. However, prefix lengths for index specifications in CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and CREATE INDEX statements are interpreted as number of characters for nonbinary string types (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT) and number of bytes for binary string types (BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB). Take this into account when specifying a prefix length for a nonbinary string column that uses a multibyte character set. Packed Indicates how the key is packed. NULL if it is not. Null Contains YES if the column may contain NULL values and '' if not. Index_type The index method used (BTREE, FULLTEXT, HASH, RTREE). Comment Information about the index not described in its own column, such as disabled if the index is disabled. Visible Whether the index is visible to the optimizer. Expression For a nonfunctional key part, Column_name indicates the column indexed by the key part and Expression is NULL.For a functional key part, Column_name column is NULL and Expression indicates the expression for the key part."},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-index/#syntax","title":"Syntax","text":"<pre><code>&gt; SHOW {INDEX | INDEXES}\n    {FROM | IN} tbl_name\n    [{FROM | IN} db_name]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-index/#explanations","title":"Explanations","text":"<p>An alternative to tbl_name FROM db_name syntax is db_name.tbl_name.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-index/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>CREATE TABLE show_01(sname varchar(30),id int);\nmysql&gt; show INDEX FROM show_01;\n+---------+------------+------------+--------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+----------+--------+------+------------+------------------+---------+------------+\n| Table   | Non_unique | Key_name   | Seq_in_index | Column_name | Collation | Cardinality | Sub_part | Packed | Null | Index_type | Comment          | Visible | Expression |\n+---------+------------+------------+--------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+----------+--------+------+------------+------------------+---------+------------+\n| show_01 |          0 | id         |            1 | id          | A         |           0 | NULL     | NULL   | YES  |            |                  | YES     | NULL       |\n| show_01 |          0 | sname      |            1 | sname       | A         |           0 | NULL     | NULL   | YES  |            |                  | YES     | NULL       |\n| show_01 |          0 | __mo_rowid |            1 | __mo_rowid  | A         |           0 | NULL     | NULL   | NO   |            | Physical address | NO      | NULL       |\n+---------+------------+------------+--------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+----------+--------+------+------------+------------------+---------+------------+\n3 rows in set (0.02 sec)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-processlist/","title":"SHOW PROCESSLIST","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Other/SHOW-Statements/show-processlist/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p><code>SHOW PROCESSLIST</code> is used to view a list of currently executing threads (also known as a process list), providing information about all active connections and executing queries on the MatrixOne server.</p> <p><code>SHOW PROCESSLIST</code> is used to monitor and manage activities in the database, identify potential issues, help diagnose query performance problems, and aid in decision-making to optimize database operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Monitoring Database Activity: By executing <code>SHOW PROCESSLIST</code>, you can view the queries and operations currently running in the database in real time.

Other columns can be identified in the <code>SELECT</code> list, including aggregate or non-aggregate function columns.

The purpose of this mode is to avoid inserting invalid or illegal values into a date or datetime field and require the use of a valid date or datetime values. If such an operation is performed, an error will be reported. It should be noted that the <code>NO_ZERO_DATE</code> mode is only effective for insert or update operations. For existing <code>0000-00-00</code> values, they can still be queried and used.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO</code>: This mode throws an error when dividing by zero.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION</code>: This mode throws an error when executing <code>ALTER TABLE</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements. The purpose of this mode is to force the use of the specified storage engine, preventing data inconsistencies or performance issues. The specified storage engine is unavailable or does not exist instead of automatically substituting it with another available storage engine. If automatic substitution of storage engines is desired, this mode can be removed from the sql_mode or set to other supported sql_mode methods. It is important to note that this mode only applies to <code>ALTER TABLE</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements and does not affect the storage engine of existing tables.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/sql-mode/#optional-modes-for-sql_mode","title":"Optional modes for sql_mode","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>ANSI</code>: ANSI is a standard SQL language specification developed by <code>ANSI</code> (American National Standards Institute). In <code>ANSI</code> mode, SQL statements must comply with the <code>ANSI</code> SQL standard, which means that specific SQL language extensions or features specific to a particular database cannot be used.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ALLOW_INVALID_DATES</code>: <code>ALLOW_INVALID_DATES</code>, also known as \"loose mode\" in MatrixOne SQL mode, allows the insertion of invalid dates in standard date format, such as '0000-00-00' or '2000-00-00'. This mode exists to be compatible with some earlier versions of MySQL and non-standard date formats. It is important to note that inserting invalid dates in <code>ALLOW_INVALID_DATES</code> mode can cause unexpected behavior, as invalid dates will not be handled appropriately. Therefore, it is always recommended to use the standard date format.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ANSI_QUOTES</code>: <code>ANSI_QUOTES</code> is a strict mode in SQL mode, used to enforce SQL standards more strictly. In <code>ANSI_QUOTES</code> mode, MatrixOne treats double quotes as identifier quotes instead of string quotes. If you want to use double quotes to quote an identifier such as a table name or column name, you must use double quotes instead of single quotes. For example, the following SQL statement is correct in <code>ANSI_QUOTES</code> mode:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>SELECT \"column_name\" FROM \"table_name\";\n</code></pre> <p>In the default SQL mode, double quotes will be interpreted as string quotes, resulting in incorrect syntax. Therefore, to use double quotes to quote identifiers, you must set MatrixOne to the <code>ANSI_QUOTES</code> mode.</p> <p>It should be noted that using the <code>ANSI_QUOTES</code> mode may cause SQL syntax incompatibility with other database systems because most other database systems use double quotes as string quotes rather than identifier quotes. Therefore, <code>ANSI_QUOTES</code> mode should be used cautiously when writing portable SQL statements.</p> <ul> <li><code>HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE</code>: <code>HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE</code> is called the \"high-priority <code>NOT</code> operator\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In <code>HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE</code> mode, MatrixOne treats the <code>NOT</code> operator as a high-priority operator, meaning its priority is higher than most other operators. This means that if you use both the <code>NOT</code> operator and other operators in an SQL statement, MatrixOne will first calculate the result of the <code>NOT</code> operator and then calculate the results of the other operators. For example:</li> </ul> <pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT column = 1 AND column2 = 'value';\n</code></pre> <p>In <code>HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE</code> mode, MatrixOne will first calculate the result of <code>NOT</code> column = 1, and then calculate the result of column2 = 'value'. If the <code>NOT</code> operator is not correctly placed in the statement, it may result in unexpected results.</p> <p>It should be noted that in MatrixOne's default SQL mode, the <code>NOT</code> operator has the same priority as other operators. If you need to use the <code>HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE</code> mode, make sure to use parentheses in your SQL statements to clarify the priority.</p> <ul> <li><code>IGNORE_SPACE</code>: <code>IGNORE_SPACE</code> is referred to as the \"ignore space\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In <code>IGNORE_SPACE</code> mode, MatrixOne ignores multiple spaces or tabs in an SQL statement and only considers one space or tab as a delimiter. This means that the following two SQL statements are equivalent in <code>IGNORE_SPACE</code> mode:</li> </ul> <pre><code>SELECT * FROM my_table;\nSELECT*FROM my_table;\n</code></pre> <p>The purpose of this mode is to make SQL statements more flexible and readable by allowing any number of spaces or tabs between keywords. However, it should be noted that in some cases, this mode may cause unexpected behavior, such as syntax errors when spaces or tabs are incorrectly placed in SQL functions or column names.</p> <p>By default, MatrixOne does not enable the <code>IGNORE_SPACE</code> mode. To enable this mode, you can use the SQL command <code>SET sql_mode='IGNORE_SPACE'</code> when connecting to MatrixOne.</p> <ul> <li><code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code>: <code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code> is called the \"no auto value on zero\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In <code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code> mode, when you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, MatrixOne does not treat it as an auto-increment value but as a regular 0 value. This means that if you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, the value of that column will not be automatically incremented but will remain 0 in <code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code> mode. For example, the following SQL statement will not auto-increment the id column in <code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code> mode:</li> </ul> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE my_table (\nid INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\nname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\nPRIMARY KEY (id)\n);\n\nINSERT INTO my_table (id, name) VALUES (0, 'John');\n</code></pre> <p>In the default SQL mode, when you insert a value of 0 into an auto-increment column, MatrixOne treats it as an auto-increment value and automatically increases it to the next available one. However, this may not be the desired behavior in some cases, so you can use the <code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code> mode to disable it.</p> <p>If you use the <code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code> mode, inserting data with a value of 0 may cause primary key duplicates or unique vital conflicts. So, extra attention is needed when you insert data.</p> <ul> <li><code>NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code>: <code>NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> is also known as \"no backslash escapes\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In <code>NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> mode, MatrixOne does not treat the backslash as an escape character. This means that you cannot use the backslash to escape special characters, such as quotes or percent signs, in SQL statements. Instead, if you need to use these special characters in SQL statements, you must use other methods to escape them, such as using single quotes to represent double quotes in strings. For example, the following SQL statement will cause a syntax error in <code>NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> mode:</li> </ul> <pre><code>SELECT 'It's a nice day' FROM my_table;\n</code></pre> <p>In the default SQL mode, MatrixOne allows backslashes to escape special characters, so backslashes can be used in SQL statements to run characters such as quotes and percent signs. However, in some cases, using backslash escapes may result in confusion or incorrect results, so the <code>NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> mode can be used to prohibit this behavior.</p> <p>If you use the <code>NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> mode, you must use other ways to escape special characters, which may make SQL statements more complex and difficult to understand. Therefore, it's necessary to consider when using this mode carefully.</p> <ul> <li><code>NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</code>: known as \"no directory in create\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode, prohibits directory paths in <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements. In the <code>NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</code> mode, MatrixOne will report an error when a directory path is used in the column definition of a <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement, which includes a way that contains a file name. For example:</li> </ul> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE my_table (\nid INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\nname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\ndatafile '/var/lib/MatrixOne/my_table_data.dat',\nPRIMARY KEY (id)\n);\n</code></pre> <p>In the SQL statement above, the datafile column defines a path containing a file name, specifying the file storing table data. In the <code>NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</code> mode, MatrixOne does not allow the use of such directory paths in <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements and requires that the file path and file name be defined separately, for example:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE my_table (\nid INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\nname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\ndatafile VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\nPRIMARY KEY (id)\n) DATA DIRECTORY '/var/lib/MatrixOne/' INDEX DIRECTORY '/var/lib/MatrixOne/';\n</code></pre> <p>The data file column in the SQL statement above only defines the file name. In contrast, the file path is defined separately in the <code>DATA DIRECTORY</code> and <code>INDEX DIRECTORY</code> clauses of the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement.</p> <p>It should be noted that the <code>NO_DIR_IN_CREATE</code> mode does not affect column definitions in already created tables but only affects column definitions in <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements. Therefore, when using this mode, you'll need careful consideration to ensure your SQL statements meet its requirements.</p> <ul> <li><code>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</code>: <code>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</code> is also also known as \"no unsigned subtraction\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode, treats the result of the subtraction of unsigned integers with the subtraction operator (-) as a signed integer instead of an unsigned integer. This means that if the value of the unsigned integer is smaller than the subtrahend, the result will be a negative number instead of an unsigned integer. For example:</li> </ul> <pre><code>SET SQL_MODE = 'NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION';\nSELECT CAST(1 AS UNSIGNED) - CAST(2 AS UNSIGNED);\n</code></pre> <p>In the SQL statement above, the <code>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</code> mode treats <code>CAST(1 AS UNSIGNED) - CAST(2 AS UNSIGNED)</code> as a signed integer operation, so the result is -1 instead of the result of an unsigned integer operation, which is 4294967295.</p> <p>It should be noted that the <code>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</code> mode only affects unsigned integers that are subtracted using the subtraction operator (-), and other operations that use unsigned integers are not affected. If you need to perform many unsigned integer operations in MatrixOne, using appropriate type conversions in your code is recommended to avoid potential errors.</p> <ul> <li><code>PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH</code>: <code>PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH</code> is called the \"pad CHAR to full length\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode.</li> </ul> <p>In the <code>PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH</code> mode, when you define a column of <code>CHAR</code> type, MatrixOne pads the column's value with spaces to make its length equal to the length specified for the column. This is because in MatrixOne, a column of <code>CHAR</code> type always occupies the defined length when stored, and any shortfall is filled with spaces. However, by default, the character set used by MatrixOne may be a multi-byte character set, so if spaces are used for padding, it may lead to incorrect length calculation.</p> <p>In the <code>PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH</code> mode, MatrixOne uses the maximum character length of the character set to pad the column of <code>CHAR</code> type to ensure that the length it occupies matches the defined size. This can avoid the problem of length calculation errors when using multi-byte character sets, but it also increases the use of storage space.</p> <p>It should be noted that the <code>PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH</code> mode only affects columns of <code>CHAR</code> type and does not affect columns of other varieties. If you need to use <code>CHAR</code> type columns in MatrixOne and correctly calculate the length of column values in a multi-byte character set, you can consider using the <code>PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH</code> mode.</p> <ul> <li><code>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</code>: <code>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</code> is called the \"pipes as concatenation\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In the <code>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</code> mode, MatrixOne treats the vertical bar symbol (|) as a string concatenation rather than a bitwise operator. If you use the standing bar symbol to concatenate two strings, MatrixOne will treat them as one string instead of interpreting them as a binary bit operation.</li> </ul> <p>For example, the following SQL statement will return an error in the default mode because MatrixOne treats the vertical bar symbol as a bitwise operator:</p> <pre><code>SELECT 'abc' | 'def';\n</code></pre> <p>However, if the SQL mode is set to <code>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</code>, the above SQL statement will return the string 'abcdef'.</p> <p>Note that if your SQL statement contains the vertical bar symbol and it should be treated as a bitwise operator, do not use the <code>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</code> mode. Conversely, if you need to treat the vertical bar symbol as a string concatenation operator, use the <code>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</code> mode.</p> <ul> <li><code>REAL_AS_FLOAT</code>: <code>REAL_AS_FLOAT</code> is known as \"treat REAL type as FLOAT type\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode.</li> </ul> <p>In <code>REAL_AS_FLOAT</code> mode, MatrixOne treats data of the <code>REAL</code> type as data of the <code>FLOAT</code> type. This means that MatrixOne uses the storage format of the <code>FLOAT</code> type to store data of the <code>REAL</code> type, rather than the more precise but also more space-consuming <code>DOUBLE</code> type storage format.</p> <p>Note that since the storage format of <code>FLOAT</code> type data occupies less space than DOUBLE type data, treating data of the <code>REAL</code> type as data of the <code>FLOAT</code> type can save storage space in some cases. However, doing so will also reduce the precision of the data, as <code>FLOAT</code> type data can only provide about 7 significant digits of precision, while <code>DOUBLE</code> type data can provide about 15 significant digits of precision.</p> <p>If you need to store high-precision floating-point data in MatrixOne, it is recommended not to use the <code>REAL_AS_FLOAT</code> mode and use DOUBLE type data to store it. If you do not require high data precision, you may consider using the <code>REAL_AS_FLOAT</code> mode to save storage space.</p> <ul> <li><code>STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code>: <code>STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code> is known as \"enable strict mode\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In <code>STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code> mode, MatrixOne enables a series of strict checks to ensure that insert, update, and delete operations comply with constraints such as data types, NULL values, and foreign keys. Specifically, <code>STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code> mode performs the following operations:</li> </ul> <p>a. Rejects illegal values from being inserted into any column.    b. Rejects NULL values from being inserted into non-NULL columns.    c. Rejects values outside the allowed range from being inserted into any column.    d. Rejects strings from being inserted into numeric type columns.    e. Rejects date or time strings from being inserted into non-date or time type columns.    f. Rejects values that exceed the length defined for <code>CHAR</code>, <code>VARCHAR</code>, and <code>TEXT</code> type columns from being inserted.    g. Rejects values with mismatched data types from being inserted into foreign key columns.</p> <p>Note that enabling strict mode may cause problems for some old applications as they may assume that MatrixOne does not perform mandatory constraint checks. If you encounter problems when updating or migrating applications, consider disabling strict mode or modifying the application to comply with strict mode requirements.</p> <ul> <li><code>TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL</code>: <code>TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL</code> is known as \"truncate fractional part of time\" mode in MatrixOne SQL mode. In <code>TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL</code> mode, MatrixOne truncates the fractional part of data of the <code>TIME</code>, <code>DATETIME</code>, and <code>TIMESTAMP</code> types, retaining only the integer part. This means that if you insert time data with a fractional part into a column of the <code>TIME</code>,<code>DATETIME</code>, or <code>TIMESTAMP</code> type, MatrixOne will truncate the fractional part and set it to 0.</li> </ul> <p>Note that enabling the <code>TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL</code> mode may cause some loss of data precision, as truncating the fractional part may lose some critical time information. If you need to store and manipulate accurate time data, it is recommended not to use the <code>TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL</code> mode.</p> <ul> <li><code>TRADITIONAL</code>: <code>TRADITIONAL</code> is a type of schema in the MatrixOne SQL mode, also known as the \"traditional\" mode. In <code>TRADITIONAL</code> mode, MatrixOne enables a series of strict checks to ensure that insert, update, and delete operations conform to SQL standard constraints. Specifically, the <code>TRADITIONA</code>L mode performs the following operations:</li> </ul> <p>a. Enables <code>STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</code> and <code>STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code> modes.    b. Rejects <code>INSERT</code> statements that omit column names to ensure all columns are explicitly assigned values.    c. Rejects inserting values with unclear data types into foreign key columns.    d. Rejects inserting strings into numeric columns.    e. Rejects inserting date or time strings into non-date or time-type columns.    f. Rejects inserting values that exceed the defined length of <code>CHAR</code>, <code>VARCHAR</code>, and <code>TEXT</code> columns.    g. Rejects using non-aggregate columns in the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause.    h. Rejects using non-listed non-aggregate columns in the <code>SELECT</code> statement.    i. It should be noted that enabling traditional mode may cause issues with some older applications that assume MatrixOne will not perform mandatory constraint checks. If you encounter problems when updating or migrating applications, consider the traditional disabling mode or modifying the applications to comply with traditional mode requirements.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/sql-mode/#how-to-set-sql_mode","title":"How to set sql_mode","text":"<p>The sql_mode can be set using the <code>SET</code> statement, for example:</p> <pre><code>SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY';\n</code></pre> <p>The sql_mode can also be set in the configuration file of MatrixOne, for example:</p> <pre><code>sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY;\n</code></pre> <p>In the example settings above, MatrixOne will use the <code>STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</code>, <code>NO_ZERO_IN_DATE</code>, and <code>ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY</code> modes.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/sql-mode/#constraints","title":"Constraints","text":"<p>MatrixOne is compatible with MySQL, except the <code>ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY</code> mode; other modes of sql_mode only implement syntax support.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Variable/system-variables/system-variables-overview/","title":"Server System Variables","text":"<p>MatrixOne server system variables are variables used to control or configure the behavior of the database engine or other components in the MatrixOne server.

Additionally, we have fixed the issue where a single module failure in the distributed architecture would cause a system-wide collapse.</p> <p>To enhance performance, this iteration has focused on read and write optimization. For reading, we have implemented Zonemap-based statistical information and provided a better execution plan. We have also added the Cluster by field when creating a table to arrange data in advance, making it easier to obtain data faster. Furthermore, we have optimized many performance bottlenecks, including the IN operator, type conversion, and predicate filtering.

It needs to be granted to a user. In a account, the user cannot perform any operations if a user is not granted a role.</p> <p>Role is set up to save the operation cost of granting the same authority. The three privileges p1, p2, and p3 must be granted to users u1, u2, and u3. You only need to grant p1, p2, and p3 to role r1 first, then grant role r1 to users u1, u2, and u3 simultaneously. It is easier to operate than granting each privilege to each user separately, and this advantage will become more obvious as the number of users and privileges increases. At the same time, the emergence of roles further abstracts the privilege set and its relationship, which is also very convenient for later privilege maintenance.</p> <p>After the cluster and account (Account) are created, MatrixOne will automatically create some default roles and users (see the Initialization Access section below for details); these roles have the highest management authority and are used to manage the cluster and account at the beginning ( Account), we do not recommend that you grant these roles to users who execute SQL daily. Excessive privileges will introduce more security issues. Therefore, MatrixOne supports the creation of custom roles. You can customize roles according to the user's business needs and assign appropriate privileges to these roles.</p> <p>Highlights</p> <p>In MatrixOne, the behavior details of roles are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>A role can be granted multiple privileges.</li> <li>A role can be granted to multiple users.</li> <li> <p>A role can pass its privileges to another role.</p> <ul> <li>Use all the privileges of a role to another role; for example, pass all the privileges of role1 to role2, then role2 inherits the privileges of role1,</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Roles and users only take effect within their respective Account, including the Sys Account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <ol> <li>The privilege inheritance of roles is dynamic. If the privileges of the inherited role change, the scope of privileges inherited by the inherited role will also change dynamically.</li> <li>The inheritance relationship of roles cannot form a loop. For example, role1 inherits role2, role 2 inherits role3, and role3 inherits role1.</li> <li>The transfer of privileges between roles makes privilege management more convenient, but it also has risks. For this reason, MatrixOne only allows roles with Manage Grants privilege to do this kind of operation. This privilege is granted to the system default role MOADMIN by default or ACCOUNTADMIN, and it is not recommended to grant this privilege to a custom role when creating a new one.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Security/role-priviledge-management/about-privilege-management/#role-switching","title":"Role Switching","text":"<p>A user is granted multiple roles to perform different types of data services.</p> <p>Main role: The user can only use one of the roles at a particular moment; we call the currently used role main role.</p> <p>Secondary role: In addition to the main role, the set of other roles owned by the user is called the secondary role.</p> <p>By default, if a user wants to execute SQL with another role's privilege, he needs to switch roles first (Use SQL as <code>set role &lt;role&gt;</code>).

industry-standard benchmark for OLTP databases. TPC-C models a warehouse-centric order processing application, and the database used in the TPC-C benchmark consists of nine tables, such as Warehouse, Customer, Order, Item, and so on (See the below ER diagram). Except for the item table, each record is populated on a per-warehouse basis, and the number of warehouses can be configurable as a scale factor.</p> <p></p> <p>TPC-C has five transaction types: NewOrder, Payment, OrderStatus, Delivery, and StockLevel. The request rate of each transaction is defined in the specification, and almost 90% of transactions are NewOrder and Payment, which are write-intensive. TPC-C transactions mostly access a single (local) warehouse, but about 10% of transactions interact with another (remote) warehouse.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#before-you-start","title":"Before you start","text":"<p>Make sure you have already Deployed standalone MatrixOne.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#clone-mo-tpcc-repository","title":"Clone mo-tpcc repository","text":"<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tpcc.git\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#steps","title":"Steps","text":""},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This section will teach you how to generate the TPCC data, create TPCC tables, load data to MatrixOne, and run TPCC.</p> <p>Now you can execute commands step by step as the following descriptions.</p>"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/performance-testing/TPCC-test-with-matrixone/#1-configure-the-propsmo-file","title":"1.
