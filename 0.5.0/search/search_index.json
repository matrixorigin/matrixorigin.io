Term Definition A AST (Abstract syntax tree) Abstract Syntax Trees or ASTs are tree representations of code. They are a fundamental part of the way a compiler works. C Cluster A distributed MatrixOne deployment, which acts as a single logical application. D Data Storage A DataStorage is an interface for implementing distributed storage service. DataStorage needs to be implemented based on the characteristics of storage engine. E Event Notify The machanism of synchronizing heartbeat information to all nodes is called an event notify. Explicit Transactions Explicit Transaction has the beginning, ending and rollback of transactions with the command Begin Transaction, Commit Transaction and Rollback Transaction. F Factorization The factorization method uses basic factorization formula to reduce any algebraic or quadratic equation into its simpler form. MatrixOne uses compact factorized representations at the physical layer to reduce data redundancy and boost query performance. H Heartbeat Every node in a MatrixOne cluster will periodically sends its status information, this information is called a heartbeat. I Implicit Transactions Implicit Transaction is the auto commit. There is no beginning or ending of the transaction. M P Prophet Prophet is a scheduling module . It takes charge of Auto-Rebalance, which keeps the system storage level and read/write throughput level balanced across Stores. The initial 3 Stores of a MatrixCube cluster are all Prophet Nodes. Pure Storage In contrast to Prophet, pure storage is another type of node, which doesn't handle any scheduling job and works as simple storage. R Replica To provide reliable service, each shard is stored not only once, it will have several copy stored in different stores. Every copy of a shard is called a Replica. S Snapshot Isolation (SI) Snapshot Isolation is a multi-version concurrency control approach that is widely used in practice. MatrixOne supports distributed transaction of snapshot isolation level. Store A distributed system consists of several physical servers, our data are stored across these physical server. We call each server inside this cluster a Store. Shard In MatrixOne, the data are split into different partitions to store in order to get better scalability. Each partition is called a Shard. In our design, a new created table is initially a Shard. When the size of the table exceeds the Shard size limit, the Shard will split. Shard Splitting There is a certain limit to a Shard size. Whenever a Shard exceeds its storage limit, Distributed system splits a Shard into two Shards and keep each Shard with the same storage level. Shard Proxy The Shard Proxy is a central module to accept all user read/write requests and route requests to corresponding nodes. Concepts MatrixOne relies heavily on the following concepts. Being familiar with them will help you understand what our architecture achieves. Term Definition A Auto-Rebalance A modern distributed database should do more than just split data amongst a number of servers. The automatic process of storage and workload distribution among servers is called an Auto-Rebalance. C Consistency MatrixOne supports a strong consistency. It is guaranted that after any successful data write, the reading afterwards will get the latest value, no matter from which store. E Execution Plan An execution plan in a database is a simple graphical representation of the operations that the query optimizer generates to calculate the most efficient way to return a set of results. F Fault-Tolerance Fault-Tolerance simply means a system's ability to continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of one or more of its components. J JIT Compilation Turns SQL plan tree or Intermediate Representation code into a native program using LLVM at runtime. M Monolithic Engine A monolithic database engine is designed to support hybrid workloads: transactional, analytical, streaming, time-series, machine learning, etc. Materialized View A materialized view is a pre-computed data set derived from a query specification (the SELECT in the view definition) and stored for later use. Materialized view is usually used for increasing performance and efficiency. Metadata Metadata is the data that describes the structure and creation method of data in a database. P Paxos Paxos is an algorithm that is used to achieve consensus among a distributed set of computers that communicate via an asynchronous network. R Raft Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. Raft Group and Leader Raft defines a strong, single leader and number of followers in a group of peers. The group represents a replicated state machine. Only the leader may service client requests. The leader replicates actions to the followers. S SIMD instruction SIMD is short for Single Instruction/Multiple Data, while the term SIMD operations refers to a computing method that enables processing of multiple data with a single instruction. T Transaction A set of operations performed on your database that satisfy the requirements of ACID semantics. V Vectorized Execution Vectorized data processing helps with developing faster analytical query engines by making efficient utilization of CPU cache. Arrow's columnar format allows to use lightweight schemes like dictionary encoding, bit packing, and run length encoding, which favor query performance over compression ratio.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#glossary","text":"","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"MatrixOne/glossary/#terms","text":"It's helpful to understand a few terms before reading our architecture documentation.

When you are ready to commit, be sure to follow the style guide to write a good commit message, a good Pull Request title, and a description. Why a good commit message matters To speed up the reviewing process Help the reviewers better understand the PR Allow ignoring unimportant commits To help us write good Release Notes To help the future maintainers establish the context Provide better information when browsing the history What is a good commit message Elements of a good commit message: What is your change? (mandatory) It can be fixing a specific bug, adding a feature, improving performance, reliability, and stability, or just being a change for the sake of correctness. Why was this change made? (mandatory) For short and obvious patches, this part can be omitted, but it should be a clear description of what the approach was. What effect does the commit have? (optional) In addition to the obvious effects, this may include benchmarks, side effects, etc. For short and obvious patches, this part can be omitted. How to write a good commit message To write a good commitment message, we suggest following a good format, cultivating good habits, and using good language. Format of a good commit message Please follow the following style for all your commits : <subsystem>: <what changed> <BLANK LINE> <why this change was made> <BLANK LINE> <footer>(optional) For the first subject line: Use no more than 70 characters. If the changes affect two subsystems, use a comma (and whitespace) to separate them like util/codec, util/types: . If the changes affect three or more subsystems, you can use * instead, like *: . Use a lowercase letter on the text that immediately follows the colon. For example: \"media: update the DM architecture image\" Do not add a period at the end of a commit message. For the second line, always leave it blank. For the why part, if there is no specific reason for the change, you can use one of the generic reasons like \"Improve performance\", \"Improve test coverage.\" For other lines, use no more than 80 characters. Habits for a good commit message Summarize your change Describe clearly one logical change and avoid lazy messages as misc fixes Describe any limitations of the current code Do not end the subject with a period \".\" Do not assume the code is self-evident Do not assume reviewers understand the original issue Language for a good commit message Use the imperative mood for the first subject line Use simple verb tenses (eg. use \"add\" not \"added\") Use correct and standard grammar Use words and expressions consistently Use relatively short sentences Do not use lengthy compound words Do not abbreviate unless it's absolutely necessary Pull Request description style For the Pull Request description in the Conversation box, please refer to the following Pull Request description template and include the necessary information: **What type of PR is this?** - [ ] API-change - [ ] BUG - [ ] Improvement - [ ] Documentation - [ ] Feature - [ ] Test and CI - [ ] Code Refactoring **Which issue(s) this PR fixes:** issue # **What this PR does / why we need it:** **Special notes for your reviewer:** **Additional documentation (e.g. design docs, usage docs, etc.):** You may also use the checklist style to list contents if needed.

The MatrixOne community strives to make the contribution process simple and straightforward. To do that, we create this page to walk you through the whole process step by step. Before you start Before you contribute, please take a minute to familiarize yourself with basic Markdown syntax and look at our Code of Conduct and the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide for some guidance on writing accessible, consistent, and inclusive documentation. How is MatrixOne documentation project organized? The MatrixOne documentation is managed in 3 repositories: The main project framework and CI&CD settings are in the matrixorigin.io repo. The markdown contents are in the docs/en/MatrixOne folder of matrixone repo. The images and unstructured data are located in the artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io repo contains a submodule that links to matrixone repo contents. The images are referred to as web image links from artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io has implemented a CI&CD project, which will be triggered by a new code merge and manual launch. This CI&CD workflow publishes the documentation to https://docs.matrixorigin.io/ . The documentation project is based on the mkdocs-material . You can find the corresponding syntax and commands with this project. MatrixOne Documentation Structure The MatrixOne documentation content is planned with 6 main modules. Overview : MatrixOne's introduction, features, architecture. Get Started : How to quickly deploy and run a MatrixOne in a standalone or a distributed environment. Reference : SQL reference, Configuration parameters, Error Codes. FAQs : Product, Technical Design, SQL, Deployment FAQs. Develop : How to develop some applications based on MatrixOne using different programming languages. Troubleshoot : Introduce common errors and debugging tools. Release Notes : Release notes of all versions. Contribution Guide : How to contribute to MatrixOne project. Lift a finger If you are just correcting a typo or grammatical error, feel free to go ahead and create a pull request . Contribute Workflow 1 . File an issue and assign it to yourself by commenting /assign . 2 . Fork matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. 3 . Clone the matrixorigin.io repo, using --recursive to retrieve the submodule of matrixone repo. git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/matrixorigin.io.git Clone the matrixone repo to the other folder in local: git clone git@github.com:yourusername/matrixone.git 4 . Add matrixone repo as a remote repository in your local matrixone folder with: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git Add matrixorigin.io repo as a remote repository in your local matrixorigin.io folder with: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixorigin.io.git 5 . As the local repo has the full documentation project code, you can run mkdocs serve under matrixorigin.io folder, and check http://localhost:8000 to check if this project runs well. mkdocs serve 6 . Make your modification. If the modification concerns the project settings, update the sitemap with new pages, or update the CI&CD workflow code. You can always check http://localhost:8000 to see if your modification is effective. If your modification is about the markdown contents, after you update the docs submodule of matrixorigin.io , the same modification should be applied to the matrixone repository. 7 . Push your git commits to your remote Github matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. We recommend you push to a new branch using the following commands: git push origin main:NEW_BRANCH 8 . Go back to GitHub, and submit a pull request in NEW_BRANCH so that we can review your changes. 9 . Once your code for both repositories is merged, you'll wait for a CI&CD workflow to restart running until the documentation website being updated. Note So once your pull requests are merged, the update to the website is not immediate. We'll need to run a manual launch to update it. 10 . At last, you should update your local and remote repo to help keep committing history clean. Override your local committing repo with: git pull --force upstream main:main Update the main branch of your remote repo in Github: git push --force origin main:main Note Most processes should be implemented in both matrixorigin.io and matrixone .

It's not necessary to doubt whether your review is constructive and useful enough because no matter how tiny, a suggestion may profoundly influence MatrixOne. Certainly, before reviewing we ask that you browse this page to learn basic requirements and relative methods. Principles of the code review When you review a pull request, there are several rules and suggestions you should take to propose better comments. Regardless of the specifics, we suggest you stay friendly first: Be respectful Be respectful to every pull request author and other reviewers. Code review is a part of community activities so you should follow the community requirements. Be careful with tone Try to frame your comments as suggestions or questions instead of commands. If the tone is softer, your reviews will be easier to accept. Be generous with your compliments We recommend you offer encouragement and appreciation to the authors for their good practices in the code segments. In many cases, telling the authors what they did is right is even more valuable than telling them what they did is wrong. Additionally, here are some suggestions in terms of content: Provide more We encourage you to provide additional details and context of your review process as much as you can. Undoubtedly, the more detailed your review, the more useful it will be to others. If you test the pull request, please report the result and your test environment details. If you request some changes, try to suggest how. Keep objective Avoid individual biased opinions and subjective emotions. Of course, everyone will comment with more or less subjective opinions. However, as a good reviewer, you should consider the technique and data facts rather than your own personal preferences. Case by case It's difficult to decide whether it's more reasonable to accept or reject when you are faced with a complex problem. Regrettably, we can't provide a certain answer because it always depends on the specific situation, which asks you to balance the pros and cons. Classifying pull requests Some pull request authors may not be familiar with MatrixOne, the MatriOne development workflow, or the MatrixOne community. They don't know what labels should be added to the pull requests or which expert could be asked for a review. If you are able to, it would be great for you to triage the pull requests, add suitable labels to the pull requests, and request corresponding experts to review the pull requests. These actions could help more contributors notice the pull requests and make quick responses. Checking pull requests There are some basic aspects to check when you review a pull request: Concentration One pull request should only do one thing. No matter how small it is, the change does exactly one thing and gets it right. Don't mix other changes into it. Tests A pull request should be test covered, whether the tests are unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. Tests should be sufficient, correct, and don't slow down the CI pipeline largely. Functionality The pull request should implement what the author intends to do, fit well in the existing code base, and resolve a real problem for users. Thus you should check whether or not the pull request achieves the intention and you could follow the discussions in the corresponding GitHub issue . Style Code in the pull request should follow a common programming style . However, sometimes the existing code is inconsistent with the style guide. You should maintain consistency with the existing code or file a new issue to fix the existing code style first. Documentation If a pull request changes how users build, test, interact with, or release code, you must check whether it also updates the related documentation such as README.md and any generated reference docs. Similarly, if a pull request deletes or deprecates code, you must check whether or not the corresponding documentation should also be deleted. Performance If you find the pull request may affect performance, you could ask the author to provide a benchmark result.","title":"Review a Pull Request"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/How-to-Contribute/review-a-pull-request/#reviews","text":"For MatrixOne, any type of review for a pull request is crucial, where you can classify the pull request to help look for more suitable experts to solve related problems or propose your suggestions to code for not only content but style.

You can go through this excellent Golang tutorial to learn some basic Golang concepts. Preparation Before you start, please make sure that you have Go installed and have cloned the MatrixOne code base. Please refer to Preparation and Contribute Code for more details. What is an aggregation function? In database systems, an aggregate function or aggregation function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together to form a single summary value. Common aggregate functions include: COUNT counts how many rows are in a particular column. SUM adds together all the values in a particular column. MIN and MAX return the lowest and highest values in a particular column, respectively. AVG calculates the average of a group of selected values. Aggregate function in MatrixOne The function join in MatrixOne's database is highly efficient and less redundant in comparison with other state-of-the-art databases via factorisation making it a key feature. Therefore, many operations in MatrixOne need to be adapted to the factorisation method, in order to improve efficiency when performing join . Aggregate functions are an example of an important feature among these operations. To implement aggragate functions in MatrixOne, we design a data structure named Ring . Every aggregate function needs to implement the Ring interface in order to be factorized when join occurs. For the common aggregate function AVG as an example, we need to calculate the number of groups and their total numeric sum, then get an average result. This is common practice for any database design. However, when a query with join occurs between two tables, the common method is to get a Cartesian product by joining tables first, then perform an AVG with that Cartesian product. This is an expensive computational cost as a Cartesian product can be very large. In MatrixOne's implementation, the factorisation method pushs down the calculation of group statistics and sum before the join operation is performed. This method helps to reduce a lot in computational and storage cost. Factorisation is realized by the Ring interface and its inner functions. To checkout more about the factorisation theory and factorised database, please refer to Principles of Factorised Databases . What is a Ring Ring is an important data structure for MatrixOne factorisation, as well as a mathematical algebraic concept with a clear definition . An algebraic Ring is a set equipped with two binary operations + (addition) and \u22c5 (multiplication) satisfying several axioms. A Ring in MatrixOne is an interface with several functions similar to the algebraic Ring structure. We use Ring interface to implement aggragate functions. The + (addition) is defined as merging two Ring s groups and the \u22c5 (multiplication) operation is defined as the computation of a grouped aggregate value combined with its grouping key frequency information. Method of Ring Interface Do What Count Return the number of groups Size Return the memory size of Ring Dup Duplicate a Ring of same type Type Return the type of a Ring String Return some basic information of Ring for execution plan log Free Free the Ring memory Grow Add a group for the Ring Grows Add multiple groups for the Ring SetLength Shrink the size of Ring, keep the first N groups Shrink Shrink the size of Ring, keep the designated groups Eval Return the eventual result of the aggregate function Fill Update the data of Ring by a row BulkFill Update the ring data by a whole vector BatchFill Update the ring data by a part of vector Add Merge a couple of groups for two Rings BatchAdd Merge several couples of groups for two Rings Mul Multiplication between groups for two Rings, called when join occurs The implementation of Ring data structure is under /pkg/container/ring/ . How does Ring work with query: To better understand the Ring interface, we can take aggregate function sum() as an example. We'll walk you through the whole process of Ring . There are two different scenarios for aggregation functions with Ring s. 1. Query with single table. In the single table scenario, when we run the below query, it generates one or several Ring s, depending on the storage blocks the T1 table is stored. The number of blocks depends on the storage strategy. Each Ring will store several groups of sums. The number of the group depends on how many duplicate rows are in this Ring . T1 ( id , class , age ) + ------+-------+------+ | id | class | age | + ------+-------+------+ | 1 | one | 23 | | 2 | one | 20 | | 3 | one | 22 | | 4 | two | 20 | | 5 | two | 19 | | 6 | three | 18 | | 7 | three | 20 | | 8 | three | 21 | | 9 | three | 24 | | 10 | three | 19 | + ------+-------+------+ select class , sum ( age ) from T1 group by class ; For example, if two Ring s were generated, the first Ring holds the group sums of the first 4 rows, which will be like: | one | 23 + 20 + 22 | | two | 20 | The second Ring holds the group sums of the last 6 rows, which will be like: | two | 19 | | three | 18 + 20 + 21 + 24 + 19 | Then the Add method of Ring will be called to merge two groups together, and at last the Eval method will return the overall result to user. | one | 23 + 20 + 22 | | two | 20 + 19 | | three | 18 + 20 + 21 + 24 + 19 | 2. Query with joining multiple tables. In the multiple tables join scenario, we have two tables Tc and Ts . The query looks like the following. Tc ( id , class ) + ------+-------+ | id | class | + ------+-------+ | 1 | one | | 2 | one | | 3 | one | | 4 | two | | 5 | two | | 6 | three | | 7 | three | | 8 | three | | 9 | three | | 10 | three | + ------+-------+ Ts ( id , age ) + ------+------+ | id | age | + ------+------+ | 1 | 23 | | 2 | 20 | | 3 | 22 | | 4 | 20 | | 5 | 19 | | 6 | 18 | | 7 | 20 | | 8 | 24 | | 9 | 24 | | 10 | 19 | + ------+------+ select class , sum ( age ) from Tc join Ts on Tc . id = Ts . id group by class ; When we run this query, it will firstly generate Ring s for the Ts table since we are performing an aggeration over the age column. It might also generate one or several Ring s same as the single table. For simplicity, we imagine only one Ring is created for each table. The Ring-Ts will start to count sums for the group of id as all id s are different, so it will maintain the same. Then a hashtable will be created for performing join operation. The Ring-Tc is created in the same time as join is performed. This Ring-Tc will count the appearing frequency f of id. Then the Mul method of Ring-Ts is called to calculate the sum calculated from the Ring-Ts and frequency from Ring-Tc . sum[i] = sum[i] * f[i] Now we get values of [class, sum(age)] , then perform a group by with class which will give us the final result. The secret of factorisation From the above example, you can see that the Ring performs some pre calculations and only the result(like sum ) is stored in its structure. When performing operations like join , only simple Add or Multiplication is needed to get the result, which is called a push down calculation in factorisation . With the help of this push down, we no longer need to deal with a costly Cartesian product. As the joined table number increases, the factorisation allows us to take linear cost of performing that instead of exponential increase. Take the implementation of Variance function as an example. The variance formula is as below: Variance = \u03a3 [(xi - x\u0305)^2]/n Example: xi = 10,8,6,12,14, x\u0305 = 10 Calculation: ((10-10)^2+(8-10)^2+(6-10)^2+(12-10)^2+(14-10)^2)/5 = 8 If we proceed with implementing this formula, we have to record all values of each group, and also maintain these values with Add and Mul operations of Ring . Eventually the result is calculated in an Eval() function. This implementation has a drawback of high memory cost since we have to store all the values during processing. In the Avg implementation, it doesn't store all values in the Ring . Instead it stores only the sum of each group and the null numbers. It returns the final result with a simple division. This method saves a lot of memory space. Now let's turn the Variance formula a bit into a different form: Variance = \u03a3 (xi^2)/n-x\u0305^2 Example: xi = 10,8,6,12,14, x\u0305 = 10 Calculation: (10^2+8^2+6^2+12^2+14^2)/5-10^2 = 8 This formula's result is exactly the same as the previous one, but we only have to record the values sum of xi^2 and the sum of xi . We can largely reduce the memory space with this kind of reformulation. To conclude, every aggregate function needs to find a way to record as little values as possible in order to reduce memory cost. Below are two different implementations for Variance (the second one has a better performance): //Implementation1 type VarRing struct { // Typ is vector's value type Typ types . Type // attributes for computing the variance Data [] byte // store all the Sums' bytes Sums [] float64 // sums of each group, its memory address is same to Data Values [][] float64 // values of each group NullCounts [] int64 // group to record number of the null value } //Implementation2 type VarRing struct { // Typ is vector's value type Typ types . Type // attributes for computing the variance Data [] byte SumX [] float64 // sum of x, its memory address is same to Data, because we will use it to store result finally. SumX2 [] float64 // sum of x^2 NullCounts [] int64 // group to record number of the null value } Develop an var() function In this tutorial, we will walk you through the complete implementation of the Variance (get the standard overall variance value) aggregate function as an example with two different methods. Step 1: register function MatrixOne doesn't distinguish between operators and functions. In our code repository, the file pkg/sql/viewexec/transformer/types.go registers aggregate functions as operators and we assign each operator a distinct integer number. To add a new function var() , first add a new const Variance in the const declaration and var in the name declaration. const ( Sum = iota Avg Max Min Count StarCount ApproxCountDistinct Variance ) var TransformerNames = [ ... ] string { Sum : \"sum\" , Avg : \"avg\" , Max : \"max\" , Min : \"min\" , Count : \"count\" , StarCount : \"starcount\" , ApproxCountDistinct : \"approx_count_distinct\" , Variance : \"var\" , } Step2: implement the Ring interface 1. Define Ring structure Create variance.go under pkg/container/ring , and define a structure of VarRing . As we calculate the overall variance, we need to calculate: The numeric Sums and the null value numbers of each group, to calculate the average. Values of each group, to calculate the variance. //Implementation1 type VarRing struct { // Typ is vector's value type Typ types . Type // attributes for computing the variance Data [] byte // store all the Sums' bytes Sums [] float64 // sums of each group, its memory address is same to Data Values [][] float64 // values of each group NullCounts [] int64 // group to record number of the null value } //Implementation2 type VarRing struct { // Typ is vector's value type Typ types . Type // attributes for computing the variance Data [] byte SumX [] float64 // sum of x, its memory address is same to Data, because we will use it to store result finally. SumX2 [] float64 // sum of x^2 NullCounts [] int64 // group to record number of the null value } 2. Implement the functions of Ring interface You can checkout the full implmetation at variance.go . Fill function //Implementation1 func ( v * VarRing ) Fill ( i , j int64 , z int64 , vec * vector . Vector ) { var value float64 = 0 switch vec . Typ . Oid { case types . T_int8 : value = float64 ( vec . Col .([] int8 )[ j ]) case ... } for k := z ; k > 0 ; k -- { v . Values [ i ] = append ( v . Values [ i ], value ) } v . Sums [ i ] += value * float64 ( z ) if nulls . Contains ( vec . Nsp , uint64 ( z )) { v . NullCounts [ i ] += z } } //Implementation2 func ( v * VarRing ) Fill ( i , j int64 , z int64 , vec * vector . Vector ) { var value float64 = 0 switch vec . Typ . Oid { case types . T_int8 : value = float64 ( vec . Col .([] int8 )[ j ]) case ... } v . SumX [ i ] += value * float64 ( z ) v . SumX2 [ i ] += math . Pow ( value , 2 ) * float64 ( z ) if nulls . Contains ( vec . Nsp , uint64 ( z )) { v . NullCounts [ i ] += z } } Add function //Implementation1 func ( v * VarRing ) Add ( a interface {}, x , y int64 ) { v2 := a .( * VarRing ) v . Sums [ x ] += v2 . Sums [ y ] v . NullCounts [ x ] += v2 . NullCounts [ y ] v . Values [ x ] = append ( v . Values [ x ], v2 . Values [ y ] ... ) } //Implementation2 func ( v * VarRing ) Add ( a interface {}, x , y int64 ) { v2 := a .( * VarRing ) v . SumX [ x ] += v2 . SumX [ y ] v . SumX2 [ x ] += v2 . SumX2 [ y ] v . NullCounts [ x ] += v2 . NullCounts [ y ] } Mul function //Implementation1 func ( v * VarRing ) Mul ( a interface {}, x , y , z int64 ) { v2 := a .( * VarRing ) { v . Sums [ x ] += v2 . Sums [ y ] * float64 ( z ) v . NullCounts [ x ] += v2 . NullCounts [ y ] * z for k := z ; k > 0 ; k -- { v . Values [ x ] = append ( v . Values [ x ], v2 . Values [ y ] ... ) } } } //Implementation2 func ( v * VarRing ) Mul ( a interface {}, x , y , z int64 ) { v2 := a .( * VarRing ) { v . SumX [ x ] += v2 . SumX [ y ] * float64 ( z ) v . SumX2 [ x ] += v2 . SumX2 [ y ] * float64 ( z ) v . NullCounts [ x ] += v2 . NullCounts [ y ] * z } } Eval function //Implementation1 func ( v * VarRing ) Eval ( zs [] int64 ) * vector . Vector { defer func () { ... }() nsp := new ( nulls . Nulls ) for i , z := range zs { if n := z - v . NullCounts [ i ]; n == 0 { nulls . Add ( nsp , uint64 ( i )) } else { v . Sums [ i ] /= float64 ( n ) var variance float64 = 0 avg := v . Sums [ i ] for _ , value := range v . Values [ i ] { variance += math . Pow ( value - avg , 2.0 ) / float64 ( n ) } v . Sums [ i ] = variance } } return ... } //Implementation2 func ( v * VarRing ) Eval ( zs [] int64 ) * vector . Vector { defer func () { ... }() nsp := new ( nulls . Nulls ) for i , z := range zs { if n := z - v . NullCounts [ i ]; n == 0 { nulls . Add ( nsp , uint64 ( i )) } else { v . SumX [ i ] /= float64 ( n ) // compute E(x) v . SumX2 [ i ] /= float64 ( n ) // compute E(x^2) variance := v . SumX2 [ i ] - math . Pow ( v . SumX [ i ], 2 ) v . SumX [ i ] = variance // using v.SumX to record the result and return. } } return ... } 3. Implement encoding and decoding for VarRing In the pkg/sql/protocol/protocol.go file, implement the code for serialization and deserialization of VarRing . Serialization function Deserialization function EncodeRing DecodeRing DecodeRingWithProcess Serialization: case * variance . VarRing : buf . WriteByte ( VarianceRing ) // NullCounts n := len ( v . NullCounts ) buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeUint32 ( uint32 ( n ))) if n > 0 { buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeInt64Slice ( v . NullCounts )) } // Sumx2 n = len ( v . SumX2 ) buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeUint32 ( uint32 ( n ))) if n > 0 { buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeFloat64Slice ( v . SumX2 )) } // Sumx da := encoding . EncodeFloat64Slice ( v . SumX ) n = len ( da ) buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeUint32 ( uint32 ( n ))) if n > 0 { buf . Write ( da ) } // Typ buf . Write ( encoding . EncodeType ( v . Typ )) return nil Deserialization: case VarianceRing : r := new ( variance . VarRing ) data = data [ 1 :] // decode NullCounts n := encoding . DecodeUint32 ( data [: 4 ]) data = data [ 4 :] if n > 0 { r . NullCounts = make ([] int64 , n ) copy ( r . NullCounts , encoding . DecodeInt64Slice ( data [: n * 8 ])) data = data [ n * 8 :] } // decode Sumx2 n = encoding . DecodeUint32 ( data [: 4 ]) data = data [ 4 :] if n > 0 { r . SumX2 = make ([] float64 , n ) copy ( r . SumX2 , encoding . DecodeFloat64Slice ( data [: n * 8 ])) data = data [ n * 8 :] } // decode Sumx n = encoding . DecodeUint32 ( data [: 4 ]) data = data [ 4 :] if n > 0 { r . Data = data [: n ] data = data [ n :] } r . SumX = encoding . DecodeFloat64Slice ( r . Data ) // decode typ typ := encoding . DecodeType ( data [: encoding . TypeSize ]) data = data [ encoding . TypeSize :] r . Typ = typ // return return r , data , nil Here we go. Now we can fire up MatrixOne and try with our var() function. Compile and run MatrixOne Once the aggregation function is ready, we can compile and run MatrixOne to see the function behavior. Step1: Run make config and make build to compile the MatrixOne project and build binary file. make config make build Info make config generates a new configuration file. In this tutorial you only need to run it once. If you modify some code and want to recompile, you only have to run make build . Step2: Run ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml to launch MatrixOne, the MatrixOne server will start to listen for client connecting. ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml Info The logger print level of system_vars_config.toml is set to default as DEBUG , which will print a lot of information for you. If you only care about what your function will print, you can modify the system_vars_config.toml and set cubeLogLevel and level to ERROR level. cubeLogLevel = \"error\" level = \"error\" Info Sometimes a port is in use error at port 50000 will occur. You could checkout what process in occupying port 50000 by lsof -i:50000 . This command helps you to get the PIDNAME of this process, then you can kill the process by kill -9 PIDNAME . Step3: Connect to MatrixOne server with a MySQL client. Use the built-in test account for example: user: dump password: 111 mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -udump -p Enter password: Step4: Test your function behavior with some data. Below is an example. You can check if you get the right mathematical variance result. You can also try an inner join and check the result, if the result is correct, the factorisation is valid. mysql > select * from variance ; + ------+------+ | a | b | + ------+------+ | 1 | 4 | | 10 | 3 | | 19 | 12 | | 239 | 114 | | 49 | 149 | | 10 | 159 | | 1 | 3 | | 34 | 35 | + ------+------+ 8 rows in set ( 0 . 04 sec ) mysql > select * from variance2 ; + ------+------+ | a | b | + ------+------+ | 14 | 3514 | | 10 | 3514 | | 1 | 61 | + ------+------+ 3 rows in set ( 0 . 02 sec ) mysql > select var ( variance . a ), var ( variance . b ) from variance ; + -----------------+-----------------+ | var ( variance . a ) | var ( variance . b ) | + -----------------+-----------------+ | 5596 . 2344 | 4150 . 1094 | + -----------------+-----------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 06 sec ) mysql > select variance . a , var ( variance . b ) from variance inner join variance2 on variance . a = variance2 . a group by variance . a ; + ------------+-----------------+ | variance . a | var ( variance . b ) | + ------------+-----------------+ | 10 | 6084 . 0000 | | 1 | 0 . 2500 | + ------------+-----------------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 04 sec ) Bingo! Info Except for var() , MatrixOne has already some neat examples for aggregate functions, such as sum() , count() , max() , min() and avg() . With some minor corresponding changes, the procedure is quite the same as other functions. \u200b Write unit Test for your function We recommend that you also write a unit test for the new function. Go has a built-in testing command called go test and a package testing which combine to give a minimal yet complete testing experience. It automates execution of any function of the form. func TestXxx(*testing.T) To write a new test suite, create a file whose name ends _test.go that contains the TestXxx functions as described here. Put the file in the same package as the one being tested. The file will be excluded from regular package builds but will be included when the go test command is run. Step1: Create a file named variance_test.go under pkg/container/ring/variance/ directory. Import the testing framework and the reflect framework we are going to use for testing. package variance import ( \"fmt\" \"github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/pkg/container/types\" \"reflect\" \"testing\" ) // TestVariance just for verify varRing related process func TestVariance ( t * testing . T ) { } Step2: Implement the TestVariance function with some predefined values. func TestVariance ( t * testing . T ) { // verify that if we can calculate // the variance of {1, 2, null, 0, 3, 4} and {2, 3, null, null, 4, 5} correctly // 1. make the test case v1 := NewVarianceRing ( types . Type { Oid : types . T_float64 }) v2 := v1 . Dup ().( * VarRing ) { // first 3 rows. // column1: {1, 2, null}, column2: {2, 3, null} v1 . SumX = [] float64 { 1 + 2 , 2 + 3 } v1 . SumX2 = [] float64 { 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 , 2 * 2 + 3 * 3 } v1 . NullCounts = [] int64 { 1 , 1 } } { // last 3 rows. // column1: {0, 3, 4}, column2: {null, 4, 5} v2 . SumX = [] float64 { 0 + 3 + 4 , 4 + 5 } v2 . SumX2 = [] float64 { 3 * 3 + 4 * 4 , 4 * 4 + 5 * 5 } v2 . NullCounts = [] int64 { 0 , 1 } } v1 . Add ( v2 , 0 , 0 ) v1 . Add ( v2 , 1 , 1 ) result := v1 . Eval ([] int64 { 6 , 6 }) expected := [] float64 { 2.0 , 1.25 } if ! reflect . DeepEqual ( result . Col , expected ) { t . Errorf ( fmt . Sprintf ( \"TestVariance wrong, expected %v, but got %v\" , expected , result . Col )) } } Step3: Complete the unit test for Serialization and Deserialization in the function TestRing in the file pkg/sql/protocol/protocol_test.go . You can check the complete test code of VarRing there. & variance . VarRing { NullCounts : [] int64 { 1 , 2 , 3 }, SumX : [] float64 { 4 , 9 , 13 }, SumX2 : [] float64 { 16 , 81 , 169 }, Typ : types . Type { Oid : types . T ( types . T_float64 ), Size : 8 }, } case * variance . VarRing : oriRing := r .( * variance . VarRing ) // Sumx if string ( ExpectRing . Data ) != string ( encoding . EncodeFloat64Slice ( oriRing . SumX )) { t . Errorf ( \"Decode varRing Sums failed.\" ) return } // NullCounts for i , n := range oriRing . NullCounts { if ExpectRing . NullCounts [ i ] != n { t . Errorf ( \"Decode varRing NullCounts failed. \\nExpected/Got:\\n%v\\n%v\" , n , ExpectRing . NullCounts [ i ]) return } } // Sumx2 for i , v := range oriRing . SumX2 { if ! reflect . DeepEqual ( ExpectRing . SumX2 [ i ], v ) { t . Errorf ( \"Decode varRing Values failed. \\nExpected/Got:\\n%v\\n%v\" , v , ExpectRing . SumX2 [ i ]) return } } Step4: Launch Test. Within the same directory as the test: go test This picks up any files matching packagename_test.go. If you are getting a PASS , you are passing the unit test. In MatrixOne, we have a bvt test framework which will run all the unit tests defined in the whole package, and each time your make a pull request to the code base, the test will automatically run. You code will be merged only if the bvt test pass. Conduct a Performance Test Aggregate functions are an important feature of a database system, with queries on hundreds of millions of data rows, the time consumption of an aggregate function is quite significant. Thus, we recommend you to run a performance test. Step1: Download the standard test dataset. We have prepared a single table SSB query dataset with 10 million rows of data. The raw data file size is about 4GB, 500MB after being zipped. You can get the data files directly: https://community-shared-data-1308875761.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/lineorder_flat.tar.bz2 Step2: Unzip the file and Load the data into MatrixOne.

Therefore, many operations in MatrixOne need to be adapted to the factorisation method, in order to improve efficiency when performing join . Aggregate functions are an example of an important feature among these operations. To implement aggragate functions in MatrixOne, we design a data structure named Ring . Every aggregate function needs to implement the Ring interface in order to be factorized when join occurs. For the common aggregate function AVG as an example, we need to calculate the number of groups and their total numeric sum, then get an average result. This is common practice for any database design. However, when a query with join occurs between two tables, the common method is to get a Cartesian product by joining tables first, then perform an AVG with that Cartesian product. This is an expensive computational cost as a Cartesian product can be very large. In MatrixOne's implementation, the factorisation method pushs down the calculation of group statistics and sum before the join operation is performed. This method helps to reduce a lot in computational and storage cost. Factorisation is realized by the Ring interface and its inner functions.

We'll walk you through the whole process of Ring . There are two different scenarios for aggregation functions with Ring s. 1. Query with single table. In the single table scenario, when we run the below query, it generates one or several Ring s, depending on the storage blocks the T1 table is stored. The number of blocks depends on the storage strategy. Each Ring will store several groups of sums. The number of the group depends on how many duplicate rows are in this Ring . T1 ( id , class , age ) + ------+-------+------+ | id | class | age | + ------+-------+------+ | 1 | one | 23 | | 2 | one | 20 | | 3 | one | 22 | | 4 | two | 20 | | 5 | two | 19 | | 6 | three | 18 | | 7 | three | 20 | | 8 | three | 21 | | 9 | three | 24 | | 10 | three | 19 | + ------+-------+------+ select class , sum ( age ) from T1 group by class ; For example, if two Ring s were generated, the first Ring holds the group sums of the first 4 rows, which will be like: | one | 23 + 20 + 22 | | two | 20 | The second Ring holds the group sums of the last 6 rows, which will be like: | two | 19 | | three | 18 + 20 + 21 + 24 + 19 | Then the Add method of Ring will be called to merge two groups together, and at last the Eval method will return the overall result to user. | one | 23 + 20 + 22 | | two | 20 + 19 | | three | 18 + 20 + 21 + 24 + 19 | 2. Query with joining multiple tables. In the multiple tables join scenario, we have two tables Tc and Ts . The query looks like the following. Tc ( id , class ) + ------+-------+ | id | class | + ------+-------+ | 1 | one | | 2 | one | | 3 | one | | 4 | two | | 5 | two | | 6 | three | | 7 | three | | 8 | three | | 9 | three | | 10 | three | + ------+-------+ Ts ( id , age ) + ------+------+ | id | age | + ------+------+ | 1 | 23 | | 2 | 20 | | 3 | 22 | | 4 | 20 | | 5 | 19 | | 6 | 18 | | 7 | 20 | | 8 | 24 | | 9 | 24 | | 10 | 19 | + ------+------+ select class , sum ( age ) from Tc join Ts on Tc . id = Ts . id group by class ; When we run this query, it will firstly generate Ring s for the Ts table since we are performing an aggeration over the age column. It might also generate one or several Ring s same as the single table. For simplicity, we imagine only one Ring is created for each table. The Ring-Ts will start to count sums for the group of id as all id s are different, so it will maintain the same. Then a hashtable will be created for performing join operation. The Ring-Tc is created in the same time as join is performed. This Ring-Tc will count the appearing frequency f of id. Then the Mul method of Ring-Ts is called to calculate the sum calculated from the Ring-Ts and frequency from Ring-Tc . sum[i] = sum[i] * f[i] Now we get values of [class, sum(age)] , then perform a group by with class which will give us the final result.","title":"How does Ring work with query:"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_aggregate_functions/#the-secret-of-factorisation","text":"From the above example, you can see that the Ring performs some pre calculations and only the result(like sum ) is stored in its structure. When performing operations like join , only simple Add or Multiplication is needed to get the result, which is called a push down calculation in factorisation . With the help of this push down, we no longer need to deal with a costly Cartesian product. As the joined table number increases, the factorisation allows us to take linear cost of performing that instead of exponential increase. Take the implementation of Variance function as an example. The variance formula is as below: Variance = \u03a3 [(xi - x\u0305)^2]/n Example: xi = 10,8,6,12,14, x\u0305 = 10 Calculation: ((10-10)^2+(8-10)^2+(6-10)^2+(12-10)^2+(14-10)^2)/5 = 8 If we proceed with implementing this formula, we have to record all values of each group, and also maintain these values with Add and Mul operations of Ring . Eventually the result is calculated in an Eval() function. This implementation has a drawback of high memory cost since we have to store all the values during processing. In the Avg implementation, it doesn't store all values in the Ring . Instead it stores only the sum of each group and the null numbers. It returns the final result with a simple division. This method saves a lot of memory space. Now let's turn the Variance formula a bit into a different form: Variance = \u03a3 (xi^2)/n-x\u0305^2 Example: xi = 10,8,6,12,14, x\u0305 = 10 Calculation: (10^2+8^2+6^2+12^2+14^2)/5-10^2 = 8 This formula's result is exactly the same as the previous one, but we only have to record the values sum of xi^2 and the sum of xi . We can largely reduce the memory space with this kind of reformulation. To conclude, every aggregate function needs to find a way to record as little values as possible in order to reduce memory cost.

In our code repository, the file pkg/sql/viewexec/transformer/types.go registers aggregate functions as operators and we assign each operator a distinct integer number. To add a new function var() , first add a new const Variance in the const declaration and var in the name declaration. const ( Sum = iota Avg Max Min Count StarCount ApproxCountDistinct Variance ) var TransformerNames = [ ... ] string { Sum : \"sum\" , Avg : \"avg\" , Max : \"max\" , Min : \"min\" , Count : \"count\" , StarCount : \"starcount\" , ApproxCountDistinct : \"approx_count_distinct\" , Variance : \"var\" , } Step2: implement the Ring interface 1. Define Ring structure Create variance.go under pkg/container/ring , and define a structure of VarRing . As we calculate the overall variance, we need to calculate: The numeric Sums and the null value numbers of each group, to calculate the average. Values of each group, to calculate the variance. //Implementation1 type VarRing struct { // Typ is vector's value type Typ types .

You can go through this excellent Golang tutorial to learn some basic Golang concepts. Preparation Before you start, please make sure that you have Go installed, cloned the MatrixOne code base. Please refer to Preparation and Contribute Code for more details. What is a built-in function? There are two types of functions in a database, built-in functions and user-defined functions. Built-in functions are functions that are shipped with the database. In contrast, user-defined functions are customized by the users. Built-in functions can be categorized according to the data types that they operate on i.e. strings, date and numeric built-in functions. An example of a built-in function is abs() , which calculates the absolute (non-negative) value of a given number. Some functions, such as abs() are used to perform calculations. Others such as getdate() are used to obtain a system value, such as the current data, or others, like left() , are used to manipulate textual data. Usually the built-in functions are categorized into major categories: Conversion Functions Logical Functions Math Functions String Functions Date Functions Develop an abs() function: In this tutorial, we use the function ABS (get the absolute value) as an example. Step 1: register function MatrixOne doesn't distinguish between operators and functions. In our code repository, the file pkg/builtin/types.go register builtin functions as operators and we assign each operator a distinct integer number. To add a new function abs() , add a new const Abs in the const declaration. const ( Length = iota + overload . NE + 1 Year Round Floor Abs ) In the directory pkg/builtin/unary , create a new go file abs.go . Info The functions under unary directory take only one value as input. The functions under binary directory take only two values as input. Other forms of functions are put under multi directory. This abs.go file has the following functionalities: 1. function name registration 2. declare all the different parameter types this function accepts, and the different return type when given different parameter types. 3. the stringification method for this function. 4. preparation for function calling and function calling. package unary func init () { } In Golang, init function will be called when a package is initialized. We wrap all ABS() 's functionality inside this init function so we don't need to call it explicitly. 1. function name registration func init () { extend . FunctionRegistry [ \"abs\" ] = builtin . Abs // register function name } In MatrixOne, all letters in a function name will be lowercased during the parsing process, so the register function names using only lowercase letters otherwise the function won't be recognized. 2. declare function parameter types and return types. The function abs accepts all numeric types as its parameter (uint8, int8, float32...), we can return a 64bit value covering all different parameter types. To optimize the performance of our function, we can also return different types with respect to the parameter type. Outside the init function, declare these variables for each pair of parameter type and return type. var argAndRets = [] argsAndRet { {[] types . T { types . T_uint8 }, types . T_uint8 }, {[] types .

Type ) ( * vector . Vector , error ) since we need a float32 vector here, its size should be 4 * len(origVecCol), 4 bytes for each float32. 2.encoding.DecodeFloat32Slice: this is just type casting. 3.Vector.Nsp: MatrixOne uses bitmaps to store the NULL values in a column, Vector.Nsp is a wrap up struct for this bitmap. 4.the boolean parameter of the Fn: this boolean value is usually used to indicate whether the vector passed in is a constant(it has length 1). Sometimes we could make use of this situation for our function implementation, for example, pkg/sql/colexec/extend/overload/plus.go. Since the result vector has the same type as the original vector, we could use the original vector to store our result when we don't need our original vector anymore in our execution plan(i.e., the reference count of the original vector is 0 or 1).

T_float64 , Fn : func ( origVec * vector . Vector , proc * process . Process , _ bool ) ( * vector . Vector , error ) { origVecCol := origVec . Col .([] float64 ) if origVec . Ref == 1 || origVec . Ref == 0 { origVec . Ref = 0 abs . AbsFloat64 ( origVecCol , origVecCol ) return origVec , nil } resultVector , err := process . Get ( proc , 8 * int64 ( len ( origVecCol )), types . Type { Oid : types . T_float64 , Size : 8 }) if err != nil { return nil , err } results := encoding . DecodeFloat64Slice ( resultVector . Data ) results = results [: len ( origVecCol )] resultVector . Col = results nulls . Set ( resultVector . Nsp , origVec . Nsp ) vector . SetCol ( resultVector , abs . AbsFloat64 ( origVecCol , results )) return resultVector , nil }, }, } } Step 2: Implement Abs function In MatrixOne, We put all of our builtin function definition code in the pkg/vectorize/ directory. To implement abs functions, first we need to create a subdirectory abs in this vectorized directory. In this fresh abs directory, create a file abs.go , the place where our abs function implementation code goes. For certain cpu architectures, we could utilize the cpu's intrinsic SIMD instruction to compute the absolute value and hence boost our function's performance, to differentiate function implementations for different cpu architectures, we declare our pure go version of abs function this way: package abs var ( AbsFloat32 func ([] float32 , [] float32 ) [] float32 AbsFloat64 func ([] float64 , [] float64 ) [] float64 ) func init () { AbsFloat32 = absFloat32 AbsFloat64 = absFloat64 } func absFloat32 ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { // See below } func absFloat64 ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { // See below } Inside the absFloat32 and absFloat64, we implement our golang version of abs function for float32 and float64 type. The other data types (int8, int16, int32, int64) are more or less the same. func absFloat32 ( xs , rs [] float32 ) [] float32 { for i := range xs { if xs [ i ] < 0 { rs [ i ] = - xs [ i ] } else { rs [ i ] = xs [ i ] } } return rs } func absFloat64 ( xs , rs [] float64 ) [] float64 { for i := range xs { if xs [ i ] < 0 { rs [ i ] = - xs [ i ] } else { rs [ i ] = xs [ i ] } } return rs } Here we go. Now we can fire up MatrixOne and take our abs function for a little spin. Compile and run MatrixOne Once the function is ready, we could compile and run MatrixOne to see the function behavior. Step1: Run make config and make build to compile the MatrixOne project and build binary file. make config make build Info make config generates a new configuration file, in this tutorial, you only need to run it once. If you modify some code and want to recompile, you only have to run make build . Step2: Run ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml to launch MatrixOne, the MatrixOne server will start to listen for client connecting. ./mo-server system_vars_config.toml Info The logger print level of system_vars_config.toml is set to default as DEBUG , which will print a lot of information for you. If you only care about what your built-in function will print, you can modify the system_vars_config.toml and set cubeLogLevel and level to ERROR level. cubeLogLevel = \"error\" level = \"error\" Info Sometimes a port is in use error at port 50000 will occur. You could checkout what process in occupying port 50000 by lsof -i:50000 . This command helps you to get the PIDNAME of this process, then you can kill the process by kill -9 PIDNAME . Step3: Connect to MatrixOne server with a MySQL client. Use the built-in test account for example: user: dump password: 111 mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -udump -p Enter password: Step4: Test your function behavior with some data. Below is an example. mysql > create table abs_test_table ( a float , b double ); Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0 . 44 sec ) mysql > insert into abs_test_table values ( 12 . 34 , - 43 . 21 ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 08 sec ) mysql > insert into abs_test_table values ( - 12 . 34 , 43 . 21 ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 02 sec ) mysql > insert into abs_test_table values ( 2 . 718 , - 3 . 14 ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 02 sec ) mysql > select a , b , abs ( a ), abs ( b ) from abs_test_table ; + ----------+----------+---------+---------+ | a | b | abs ( a ) | abs ( b ) | + ----------+----------+---------+---------+ | 12 . 3400 | - 43 . 2100 | 12 . 3400 | 43 . 2100 | | - 12 . 3400 | 43 . 2100 | 12 . 3400 | 43 . 2100 | | 2 . 7180 | - 3 . 1400 | 2 . 7180 | 3 . 1400 | + ----------+----------+---------+---------+ 3 rows in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) Bingo! Info Except for abs() , MatrixOne has already some neat examples for built-in functions, such as floor() , round() , year() . With some minor corresponding changes, the procedure is quite the same as other functions. \u200b Write a unit Test for your function We recommend that you also write a unit test for the new function. Go has a built-in testing command called go test and a package testing which combine to give a minimal but complete testing experience. It automates execution of any function of the form. func TestXxx(*testing.T) To write a new test suite, create a file whose name ends _test.go and contains the TestXxx functions as described here. Put the file in the same package as the one being tested. The file will be excluded from regular package builds but will be included when the go test command is run. Step1: Create a file named abs_test.go under vectorize/abs/ directory. Import the testing framework and the testify framework we are going to use for testing mathematical equal . package abs import ( \"testing\" \"github.com/stretchr/testify/require\" ) function TestAbsFloat32(t *testing.T) { } function TestAbsFloat64(t *testing.T) { } Step2: Implement the TestXxx functions with some predefined values. func TestAbsFloat32(t *testing.T) { //Test values nums := []float32{1.5, -1.5, 2.5, -2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, -1.2, -12.3, -123.4, -1234.5, -12345.6} //Predefined Correct Values absNums := []float32{1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6} //Init a new variable newNums := make([]float32, len(nums)) //Run abs function newNums = AbsFloat32(nums, newNums) for i := range newNums { require.Equal(t, absNums[i], newNums[i]) } } func TestAbsFloat64(t *testing.T) { //Test values nums := []float64{1.5, -1.5, 2.5, -2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, -1.2, -12.3, -123.4, -1234.5, -12345.6} //Predefined Correct Values absNums := []float64{1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6, 1234.567, 1.2, 12.3, 123.4, 1234.5, 12345.6} //Init a new variable newNums := make([]float64, len(nums)) //Run abs function newNums = AbsFloat64(nums, newNums) for i := range newNums { require.Equal(t, absNums[i], newNums[i]) } } Step3: Launch Test. Within the same directory as the test: go test This picks up any files matching packagename_test.go. If you are getting a PASS , you are passing the unit test. In MatrixOne, we have a bvt test framework which will run all the unit tests defined in the whole package, and each time your code is merged in the code base, the test will automatically run.","title":"Develop a built-in function"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_builtin_functions/#develop-a-built-in-function","text":"","title":"Develop a built-in function"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Contribution-Guide/Tutorial/develop_builtin_functions/#prerequisite","text":"To develop a built-in function for MatrixOne, you need a basic knowledge of Golang programming.

Built-in functions are functions that are shipped with the database. In contrast, user-defined functions are customized by the users. Built-in functions can be categorized according to the data types that they operate on i.e. strings, date and numeric built-in functions. An example of a built-in function is abs() , which calculates the absolute (non-negative) value of a given number. Some functions, such as abs() are used to perform calculations. Others such as getdate() are used to obtain a system value, such as the current data, or others, like left() , are used to manipulate textual data.

Step 1: register function MatrixOne doesn't distinguish between operators and functions. In our code repository, the file pkg/builtin/types.go register builtin functions as operators and we assign each operator a distinct integer number. To add a new function abs() , add a new const Abs in the const declaration. const ( Length = iota + overload . NE + 1 Year Round Floor Abs ) In the directory pkg/builtin/unary , create a new go file abs.go . Info The functions under unary directory take only one value as input. The functions under binary directory take only two values as input. Other forms of functions are put under multi directory. This abs.go file has the following functionalities: 1. function name registration 2. declare all the different parameter types this function accepts, and the different return type when given different parameter types. 3. the stringification method for this function. 4. preparation for function calling and function calling. package unary func init () { } In Golang, init function will be called when a package is initialized. We wrap all ABS() 's functionality inside this init function so we don't need to call it explicitly. 1. function name registration func init () { extend . FunctionRegistry [ \"abs\" ] = builtin . Abs // register function name } In MatrixOne, all letters in a function name will be lowercased during the parsing process, so the register function names using only lowercase letters otherwise the function won't be recognized. 2. declare function parameter types and return types. The function abs accepts all numeric types as its parameter (uint8, int8, float32...), we can return a 64bit value covering all different parameter types. To optimize the performance of our function, we can also return different types with respect to the parameter type. Outside the init function, declare these variables for each pair of parameter type and return type. var argAndRets = [] argsAndRet { {[] types . T { types . T_uint8 }, types . T_uint8 }, {[] types .

Type ) ( * vector . Vector , error ) since we need a float32 vector here, its size should be 4 * len(origVecCol), 4 bytes for each float32. 2.encoding.DecodeFloat32Slice: this is just type casting. 3.Vector.Nsp: MatrixOne uses bitmaps to store the NULL values in a column, Vector.Nsp is a wrap up struct for this bitmap. 4.the boolean parameter of the Fn: this boolean value is usually used to indicate whether the vector passed in is a constant(it has length 1). Sometimes we could make use of this situation for our function implementation, for example, pkg/sql/colexec/extend/overload/plus.go. Since the result vector has the same type as the original vector, we could use the original vector to store our result when we don't need our original vector anymore in our execution plan(i.e., the reference count of the original vector is 0 or 1).

About the demo This demo will store the historical stock data of the China stock market and make a simple analysis to find the best stocks to buy. The basic idea is that we track the P/E (Price-to-Earnings) and P/B (Price-to-Book) levels of each stock since these can represent a company's market capitalization. If you are not familiar with these two concepts, please refer to P/E and P/B . Every day after the market closes, we compare the P/E and P/B values with the historical lowest P/E and P/B. If the current P/E or P/B is even lower than the historical lowest, the stock is very likely underestimated. We can further investigate its reason for falling and judge if it's a good time to buy it. Before you start Before you start, you need to have a Tushare account and get an API token. If you haven't signed up for Tushare, you can sign up for it at https://tushare.pro/ and you can find your API token at https://tushare.pro/user/token# . Info Tushare is an open-source utility for crawling historical data of China stocks. It has a complete dataset, but pay attention to their rules of API access limit and frequency. Besides the data source account, you need to at least have this two basic software installed: Python 3.x MatrixOne You may refer to Python 3 installation tutorial and MatrixOne installation for more details. Moreover, we need to install dependent Tushare and pymysql python libraries to use Tushare and access MatrixOne. pip3 install -r requirements.txt Info Pymysql is the only ORM tool supported by MatrixOne. The other python MySQL ORM tools as SQLAlchemy , mysql-connector , MySQLdb are not supported yet. Step1: prepare and load the historical dataset First, we need to load the historical stock data in MatrixOne. As Tushare interface only allows a fetch of 5000 rows of data at once, we only have to collect the latest 5000 trade days data for each stock. Each year there are roughly 250 trade dates. 5000 makes almost 20 years of data, which largely satisfies our demo. The below code will set up tushare interface and get the list of stocks. import tushare as ts import time # Set Tushare data source ts . set_token ( 'YOUR_TUSHARE_API_TOKEN' ) pro = ts . pro_api () # Get the list of stocks pool = pro . stock_basic ( exchange = '' , list_status = 'L' , adj = 'qfq' , fields = 'ts_code,symbol,name,area,industry,fullname,list_date, market,exchange,is_hs' ) As we only need the P/E and P/B information, we call the daily_basic method and get each stock with data frames with ts_code , trade_date , pe and pb fields. Without any specification of start date and end date, Tushare will automatically output 5000 lastest records. j = 1 for i in pool . ts_code : print ( 'Getting %d stock\uff0cStock Code %s .' % ( j , i )) #The interface is limited to be queried 200 times/minute, some little delays are necessary time . sleep ( 0.301 ) j += 1 #Get stock P/E and P/B data frames df = pro . daily_basic ( ** { \"ts_code\" : i , \"trade_date\" : \"\" , \"start_date\" : \"\" , \"end_date\" : \"\" , \"limit\" : \"\" , \"offset\" : \"\" }, fields = [ \"ts_code\" , \"trade_date\" , \"pe\" , \"pb\" ]) With the data ready, we need to load them into MatrixOne. We use pymysql as the python-MatrixOne connector to run SQLs in MatrixOne. Prior to the below code, the MatrixOne server must be launched and a database called stock needs to be created first. MatrixOne: mysql > CREATE DATABASE stock . Python: import pymysql # Open a MatrixOne connection db = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=6001, user='dump', password='111', database='stock') # Create a cursor object cursor = db.cursor() # Create PE table cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pe(ts_code VARCHAR(255), trade_date VARCHAR(255), pe FLOAT, pb FLOAT)') Load each 5000 records of data into MatrixOne: if df . empty == False : # Fill P/E and P/B values which are NaN df = df . fillna ( 0.0 ) val_to_insert = df . values . tolist () cursor . executemany ( \" insert into pe (ts_code, trade_date,pe,pb) values ( %s , %s , %s , %s )\" , val_to_insert ) Step2: find the historical lowest P/E or P/B stock After we load the historical stock data into MatrixOne, we have about 11 million records. mysql > select count ( * ) from pe ; + ----------+ | count ( * ) | + ----------+ | 11233508 | + ----------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 16 sec ) Now we run a SQL to calculate the lowest P/E and P/B of each stock. # Find stocks that the current P/E is even lower than the historical lowest cursor . execute ( 'select ts_code,min(pe) from pe where pe>0 group by ts_code order by ts_code' ) # Fetch the result as python object value = cursor . fetchall () # Find stocks that the current P/B is even lower than the historical lowest cursor . execute ( 'select ts_code,min(pb) from pe where pb>0 group by ts_code order by ts_code' ) # Fetch the result as python object value = cursor . fetchall () Then we call Tushare daily_basic interface again to get the current P/E and P/B level and make a search to locate the stock whose current P/E or P/B is even lower than the historical lowest. You could of course switch any trade date you want for comparison. We take P/E as an example. df = pro . daily_basic ( ** { \"ts_code\" : \"\" , \"trade_date\" : sys . argv [ 1 ], \"start_date\" : \"\" , \"end_date\" : \"\" , \"limit\" : \"\" , \"offset\" : \"\" }, fields = [ \"ts_code\" , \"pe\" ]) df = df . fillna ( 0.0 ) for i in range ( 0 , len ( value )): ts_code , min_pe = value [ i ] for j in range ( 0 , len ( df . ts_code )): if ts_code == df . ts_code [ j ] and min_pe > df . pe [ j ] > 0 : logging . getLogger () . info ( \"ts_code: %s \" , ts_code ) logging . getLogger () . info ( \"history lowest PE : %f \" , min_pe ) logging . getLogger () . info ( \"current PE found: %f \" , df . pe [ j ]) This will print every stock with the lowest ever P/E or P/B. They are usually good choices to buy if they are not experiencing big trouble. Step3: Update our dataset We already have a lot of historical data stored in MatrixOne; each time we run an analysis, we usually have been through a new trading day. The dataset needs to be updated with the latest data, otherwise next time you will still compare yourself with the old data. We don't need to insert all data again, we just insert the data with the latest trading dates. # get updating trading dates by user argument inputs df = pro . daily_basic ( ** { \"ts_code\" : i , \"trade_date\" : \"\" , \"start_date\" : self . startDate ,, \"end_date\" : self . endDate , \"limit\" : \"\" , \"offset\" : \"\" }, fields = [ \"ts_code\" , \"trade_date\" , \"pe\" , \"pb\" ]) # append update to MatrixOne if df . empty == False : df = df . fillna ( 0.0 ) val_to_insert = df . values . tolist () print ( val_to_insert ) cursor . executemany ( \" insert into pe (ts_code, trade_date,pe,pb) values ( %s , %s , %s , %s )\" , val_to_insert ) Source Code You can find the source code of this demo at matrix_one_app .","title":"Develop Python Applications"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/develop_python_application/#build-a-simple-stock-analysis-python-app-with-matrixone","text":"This tutorial shows you how to build a simple Python application with MatrixOne.","title":"Build a simple stock analysis Python App with MatrixOne"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Develop/develop_python_application/#about-the-demo","text":"This demo will store the historical stock data of the China stock market and make a simple analysis to find the best stocks to buy.

To find this table name or attribute name in your query, it needs to be in `` as well. How do I export data from MatrixOne to a file? You can use SELECT INTO OUTFILE command to export data from MatrixOne to a csv file (only to the server host, not to the remote client). For this command, you can see SELECT Reference . What is the size limit of a transaction in MatrixOne? The transaction size is limited to the memory size you have for hardware environment. What kind of character set does MatrixOne support? MatrixOne supports the UTF-8 character set by default and currently only supports UTF-8. What is the sql_mode in MatrixOne? MatrixOne doesn't support modifying the sql_mode for now, the default sql_mode is as the only_full_group_by in MySQL. How do I bulk load data into MatrixOne? MatrixOne provides two methods of bulk load data: 1. Using source filename command from shell, user can load the SQL file with all DDL and insert data statements. 2. Using load data infile...into table... command from shell, user can load an existing .csv file to MatrixOne. How do I know how my query is executed? To see how MatrixOne executes for a given query, you can use the EXPLAIN statement, which will print out the query plan.

It consists of a suite of business oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent data modifications. The queries and the data populating the database have been chosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a high degree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions. TPC-H is a widely used benchmark for OLAP databases. By walking through this tutorial, you'll learn how to complete a TPC-H Test with MatrixOne. Before you begin Make sure you have already installed MatrixOne and connected to MatrixOne Server . 1. Compile TPCH dbgen The tpch dbgen utility generates, by default, a set of flat files suitable for loading into the tpch schema with the size based on the \u201cScale Factor\u201d argument. A scale factor of 1 produces a complete data set of approximately 1 GB, a scale factor of 10 produces a data set of approximately 10 GB etc. git clone https://github.com/electrum/tpch-dbgen.git cd ssb-dbgen make 2. Generate data Run dbgen for the appropriate database size factor (1GB in the sample). ./dbgen -s 1 Generation may take a while.

As a redefinition of the HTAP database, HSTAP aims to meet all the needs of Transactional Processing (TP) and Analytical Processing (AP) within a single database. Compared with the traditional HTAP, HSTAP emphasizes its built-in streaming capability used for connecting TP and AP tables. This provides users with an experience that a database can be used just like a Big Data platform, with which many users are already familiar thanks to the Big Data boom. With minimal integration efforts, MatrixOne frees users from the limitations of Big Data and provides one-stop coverage for all TP and AP scenarios for enterprises. MatrixOne is redesigned from scratch and introduces many innovations as well as many best practices in the other DBMS. It adopts a disaggregated storage and computes architecture, where data are stored on S3 object storage in the cloud to achieve low cost, and the compute nodes are stateless and can be started at will to achieve the ultimate elasticity. In the case of on-premises deployment, MatrixOne can utilize the user's HDFS or other supported distributed file system to save data. MatrixOne also comes with an S3-compatible built-in alternative to ensure the elasticity, high reliability, and high performance of its storage without relying on any external components. The architecture is as follows: The architecture of MatrixOne is divided into several layers: Cluster Management Layer Being responsible for cluster management, it interacts with Kubernetes to obtain resources dynamically when in the cloud-native environment, while in the on-premises deployment, it gets hold of resources based on the configuration. Cluster status is continuously monitored with the role of each node allocated based on resource information. Maintenance works are carried out to ensure that all system components are up and running despite occasional node and network failures. It rebalances the loads on nodes when necessary as well. Major components in this layer are: Prophet Scheduler: take charge of load balancing and node keep-alive. Resource Manager: being responsible for physical resources provision. Serverless Layer Serverless Layer is a general term for a series of stateless nodes, which, as a whole, contains three categories: Background tasks: the most important one is called Offload Worker, which is responsible for offloading expensive compaction tasks and flushing data to S3 storage. SQL compute nodes: responsible for executing SQL requests, here divided into write nodes and read nodes. The former also provides the ability to read the freshest data. Stream task processing node: responsible for executing stream processing requests. Log(Reliability) Layer As MatrixOne's Single Source of Truth, data is considered as persistently stored in MatrixOne once it is written into the Log Layer. It is built upon our world-class expertise in the Replicated State Machine model to guarantee state-of-the-art high throughput, high availability, and strong consistency for our data. Following a fully modular and disaggregated design by itself, it is also the central component that helps to decouple the storage and compute layers. This in turn earns our architecture much higher elasticity when compared with traditional NewSQL architecture. Storage Layer The storage layer transforms the incoming data from the Log Layer into an efficient form for future processing and storage. This includes cache maintenance for fast accessing data that has already been written to S3. In MatrixOne, TAE (Transactional Analytic Engine) is the primary interface exposed by the Storage Layer, which can support both row and columnar storage together with transaction capabilities. Besides, the Storage Layer includes other internally used storage capabilities as well, e.g. the intermediate storage for streaming. Storage Provision Layer As an infrastructure agnostic DBMS, MatrixOne stores data in shared storage of S3 / HDFS, or local disks, on-premise servers, hybrid, and any cloud, or even smart devices. The Storage Provision Layer hides such complexity from upper layers by just presenting them with a unified interface for accessing such diversified storage resources.

These types are used when it is important to preserve exact precision, for example with monetary data, or with scientific calculations. In a DECIMAL column declaration, the precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified. For example: salary DECIMAL ( 5 , 2 ) In this example, 5 is the precision and 2 is the scale. The precision represents the number of significant digits that are stored for values, and the scale represents the number of digits that can be stored following the decimal point. Standard SQL requires that DECIMAL(5,2) be able to store any value with five digits and two decimals, so values that can be stored in the salary column range from -999.99 to 999.99. In MatrixOne, the syntax DECIMAL(M) is equivalent to DECIMAL(M,0). Similarly, the syntax DECIMAL is equivalent to DECIMAL(M,0), where the implementation is permitted to decide the value of M. MatrixOne supports both of these variant forms of DECIMAL syntax. The default value of M is 10. If the scale is 0, DECIMAL values contain no decimal point or fractional part. In MatrixOne, the maximum number of digits for DECIMAL is 38, but the actual range for a given DECIMAL column can be constrained by the precision or scale for a given column. When such a column is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than are permitted by the specified scale, the value is converted to that scale. DECIMAL Data Type Characteristics This section discusses the characteristics of the DECIMAL data type (and its synonyms), with particular regard to the following topics: Maximum number of digits Storage format The declaration syntax for a DECIMAL column is DECIMAL(M,D). The ranges of values for the arguments are as follows: M is the maximum number of digits (the precision). It has a range of 1 to 38. D is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point (the scale). It has a range of 1 to 38 and must be no larger than M. If D is omitted, the default is 0. If M is omitted, the default is 10.

These types are used when it is important to preserve exact precision, for example with monetary data, or with scientific calculations. In a DECIMAL column declaration, the precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified. For example: salary DECIMAL ( 5 , 2 ) In this example, 5 is the precision and 2 is the scale. The precision represents the number of significant digits that are stored for values, and the scale represents the number of digits that can be stored following the decimal point. Standard SQL requires that DECIMAL(5,2) be able to store any value with five digits and two decimals, so values that can be stored in the salary column range from -999.99 to 999.99. In MatrixOne, the syntax DECIMAL(M) is equivalent to DECIMAL(M,0). Similarly, the syntax DECIMAL is equivalent to DECIMAL(M,0), where the implementation is permitted to decide the value of M. MatrixOne supports both of these variant forms of DECIMAL syntax. The default value of M is 10. If the scale is 0, DECIMAL values contain no decimal point or fractional part. In MatrixOne, the maximum number of digits for DECIMAL is 38, but the actual range for a given DECIMAL column can be constrained by the precision or scale for a given column. When such a column is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than are permitted by the specified scale, the value is converted to that scale.","title":"Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/Data-Types/fixed-point-types/#decimal-data-type-characteristics","text":"This section discusses the characteristics of the DECIMAL data type (and its synonyms), with particular regard to the following topics: Maximum number of digits Storage format The declaration syntax for a DECIMAL column is DECIMAL(M,D). The ranges of values for the arguments are as follows: M is the maximum number of digits (the precision). It has a range of 1 to 38. D is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point (the scale). It has a range of 1 to 38 and must be no larger than M. If D is omitted, the default is 0. If M is omitted, the default is 10.

Description This command displays the execution plan that the MatrixOne planner generates for the supplied statement. The execution plan shows how the table(s) referenced by the statement will be scanned \u2014 by plain sequential scan, index scan, etc. \u2014 and if multiple tables are referenced, what join algorithms will be used to bring together the required rows from each input table. The most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in cost units that are arbitrary, but conventionally mean disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up cost before the first row can be returned, and the total cost to return all the rows. For most queries the total cost is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery in EXISTS , the planner will choose the smallest start-up cost instead of the smallest total cost (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with a LIMIT clause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest. Parameters VERBOSE: Display additional information regarding the plan. Specifically, include the output column list for each node in the plan tree, schema-qualify table and function names, always label variables in expressions with their range table alias, and always print the name of each trigger for which statistics are displayed. This parameter is FALSE by default. FORMAT: Specify the output format, which can be TEXT, JSON. Non-text output contains the same information as the text output format, but is easier for programs to parse. This parameter is TEXT by dafault. BOOLEAN: Specifies whether the selected option should be turned on or off. You can write TRUE to enable the option, and FALSE to disable it. The boolean value can also be omitted, in which case TRUE is assumed. STETEMENT MatrixOne supports any SELECT , UPDATE , DELETE statement execution plan. For INSERT statement, only INSERT INTO..SELECT is supported in 0.5.0 version. INSERT INTO...VALUES is not supported yet. Output Structure The command's result is a textual description of the plan selected for the statement , optionally annotated with execution statistics. Take the following SQL as an example, we demonstrate the output structure. explain select city,libname1,count(libname1) as a from t3 join t1 on libname1=libname3 join t2 on isbn3=isbn2 group by city,libname1; +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | QUERY PLAN | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Project(cost=0.00..0.00 card=400.00 ndv=0.00 rowsize=0 | | -> Aggregate(cost=0.00..0.00 card=400.00 ndv=0.00 rowsize=0 | | Group Key:#[0,1], #[0,0] | | Aggregate Functions: count(#[0,0]) | | -> Join(cost=0.00..0.00 card=400.00 ndv=0.00 rowsize=0 | | Join Type: INNER | | Join Cond: (#[1,2] = #[0,0]) | | -> Table Scan on abc.t2(cost=0.00..0.00 card=8.00 ndv=0.00 rowsize=0 | | -> Join(cost=0.00..0.00 card=50.00 ndv=0.00 rowsize=0 | | Join Type: INNER | | Join Cond: (#[0,0] = #[1,1]) | | -> Table Scan on abc.t1(cost=0.00..0.00 card=5.00 ndv=0.00 rowsize=0 | | -> Table Scan on abc.t3(cost=0.00..0.00 card=10.00 ndv=0.00 rowsize=0 | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 13 rows in set (0.00 sec) EXPLAIN outputs a tree structure, named as Execution Plan Tree . Every leaf node includes the information of node type, affected objects and other properties such as cost , rowsize etc. We can simplify the above example only with node type information.

This is the time expended before the output phase can begin, e.g., time to do the sorting in a sort node. The second is estimated total cost. This is stated on the assumption that the plan node is run to completion, i.e., all available rows are retrieved. In practice a node's parent node might stop short of reading all available rows (see the LIMIT example below). card card=14.00 Estimated column cardinality. ndv ndv=0.00 Estimated number of distinct values. rowsize rowsize=0.00 Estimated rowsize. output Output: #[0,0], #[0,1], #[0,2], #[0,3], #[0,4], #[0,5], #[0,6], #[0,7] Node output information.

The execution plan shows how the table(s) referenced by the statement will be scanned \u2014 by plain sequential scan, index scan, etc. \u2014 and if multiple tables are referenced, what join algorithms will be used to bring together the required rows from each input table. The most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in cost units that are arbitrary, but conventionally mean disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up cost before the first row can be returned, and the total cost to return all the rows. For most queries the total cost is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery in EXISTS , the planner will choose the smallest start-up cost instead of the smallest total cost (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with a LIMIT clause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest.","title":"Description"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Explain/explain/#parameters","text":"VERBOSE: Display additional information regarding the plan.

Each transaction guarantees ACID semantics spanning arbitrary tables and rows. If a transaction succeeds, all mutations are applied together with virtual simultaneity. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is aborted, and the database is left unchanged. MatrixOne guarantees that while a transaction is pending, it is isolated from other concurrent transactions with snapshot isolation. In 0.5.0 version, MatrixOne supports standalone database transaction. MatrixOne supports optimistic transaction mode. This document introduces commonly used transaction-related statements, explicit and implicit transactions, isolation levels, lazy check for constraints, and transaction sizes. SQL statements The following SQL statements control transactions\uff1a START TRANSACTION or BEGIN start a new transaction. COMMIT commits the current transaction, making its changes permanent. ROLLBACK rolls back the current transaction, canceling its changes. SET autocommit disables or enables the default autocommit mode for the current session. (It's not fully implemented in 0.5.0 version, MatrixOne only supports autocommit mode enabled, it cannot be switched off yet). Starting a transaction The statements BEGIN and START TRANSACTION can be used interchangeably to explicitly start a new transaction. Syntax: BEGIN ; START TRANSACTION; With START TRANSACTION or BEGIN , autocommit remains disabled until you end the transaction with COMMIT or ROLLBACK . The autocommit mode then reverts to its previous state. Unlike MySQL, START TRANSACTION in MatrixOne doesn't have a modifier that control transaction characteristics. Committing a transaction The statement COMMIT instructs MatrixOne to apply all changes made in the current transaction. Syntax: COMMIT ; Rolling back a transaction The statement ROLLBACK rolls back and cancels all changes in the current transaction. Syntax: ROLLBACK ; Transactions are also automatically rolled back if the client connection is aborted or closed. Autocommit By default, MatrixOne runs with autocommit mode enabled. This means that, when not otherwise inside a transaction, each statement is atomic, as if it were surrounded by START TRANSACTION and COMMIT . You cannot use ROLLBACK to undo the effect; however, if an error occurs during statement execution, the statement is rolled back. For example: mysql > SELECT @@ autocommit ; + --------------+ | @@ autocommit | + --------------+ | on | + --------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) mysql > create table test ( c int primary key , d int ); Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0 . 03 sec ) mysql > Insert into test values ( 1 , 1 ); Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0 . 04 sec ) mysql > rollback ; ERROR 1105 ( HY000 ): the txn has not been began mysql > select * from test ; + ------+------+ | c | d | + ------+------+ | 1 | 1 | + ------+------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 01 sec ) In the above example, the ROLLBACK statement has no effect. This is because the INSERT statement is executed in autocommit. ROLLBACK only works with a BEGIN or START TRANSACTION . That is, it was the equivalent of the following single-statement transaction: START TRANSACTION; Insert into test values(1,1); COMMIT; Autocommit will not apply if a transaction has been explicitly started. In the following example, the ROLLBACK statement successfully reverts the INSERT statement: mysql> SELECT @@autocommit; +--------------+ | @@autocommit | +--------------+ | on | +--------------+ 1 row in set (0.01 sec) mysql> create table test (c int primary key,d int); Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec) mysql> BEGIN; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) mysql> Insert into test values(1,1); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec) mysql> ROLLBACK; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec) mysql> SELECT * from test; Empty set (0.01 sec) The autocommit system variable cannot be changed on either a global nor session basis for now. Explicit and implicit transaction MatrixOne supports explicit transactions (use [BEGIN|START TRANSACTION] and COMMIT to define the start and end of the transaction) and implicit transactions (by default). If you start a new transaction through the [BEGIN|START TRANSACTION] statement, the autocommit is disabled before COMMIT or ROLLBACK which makes the transaction becomes explicit. Statement rollback MatrixOne supports atomic rollback after statement execution failure. If a statement results in an error, the changes it made will not take effect. The transaction will remain open, and additional changes can be made before issuing a COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement. mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY); Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec) mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.16 sec) mysql> BEGIN; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1); ERROR 1105 (HY000): tae data: duplicate mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec) mysql> INSERT INTO t1_1 VALUES (3); ERROR 1105 (HY000): tae catalog: not found mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (3); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) mysql> commit; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec) mysql> select * from t1; +------+ | id | +------+ | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | +------+ 3 rows in set (0.02 sec) In the above example, the transaction remains open after the failed INSERT statements. The final insert statement is then successful and changes are committed. Snapshot Isolation Level Transaction isolation is one of the foundations of database transaction processing. Isolation is one of the four key properties of a transaction (commonly referred as ACID). The SQL-92 standard defines four levels of transaction isolation: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable. See the following table for details: Isolation Level Dirty Write Dirty Read Fuzzy Read Phantom READ UNCOMMITTED Not Possible Possible Possible Possible READ COMMITTED Not Possible Not possible Possible Possible REPEATABLE READ Not Possible Not possible Not possible Possible SERIALIZABLE Not Possible Not possible Not possible Not possible MatrixOne implements Snapshot Isolation (SI) consistency, this level of isolation is between REPEATABLE READ and SERIALIZABLE for SQL-92 standard. In a snapshot isolated system, each transaction appears to operate on an independent, consistent snapshot of the database. Its changes are visible only to that transaction until commit time, when all changes become visible atomically to any transaction which begins at a later time.If transaction T1 has modified an object x , and another transaction T2 committed a write to x after T1\u2019s snapshot began, and before T1\u2019s commit, then T1 must abort. If we look at the isolation levels with the possible anomalies allowed proposed by A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels , we can conclude MatrixOne's isolation level with such a following table, which is slightly different with the Snapshot Isolation in the article. Isolation Level P0 Dirty Write P1 Dirty Read P4C Cursor Lost Update P4 Lost Update P2 Fuzzy Read P3 Phantom A5A Read Skew A5B Write Skew MatrixOne's Snapshot Isolation Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Possible Optimistic Transaction Model MatrixOne supports an optimistic transaction model. Users who use optimistic concurrency do not lock a row when reading it. When a user wants to update a row, the application must determine whether another user has changed the row since it was read. Optimistic concurrency is generally used in environments with a low contention for data. In an optimistic concurrency model, a violation is considered to have occurred if, after a user receives a value from the database, another user modifies the value before the first user has attempted to modify it. How the server resolves a concurrency violation is best shown by first describing the following example. The following tables follow an example of optimistic concurrency. At 1:00 p.m., User1 reads a row from the database with the following values: CustID LastName FirstName 101 Smith Bob Column name Original value Current value Value in database CustID 101 101 101 LastName Smith Smith Smith FirstName Bob Bob Bob At 1:01 p.m., User2 reads the same row. At 1:03 p.m., User2 changes FirstName from \"Bob\" to \"Robert\" and updates the database. Column name Original value Current value Value in database CustID 101 101 101 LastName Smith Smith Smith FirstName Bob Robert Bob The update succeeds because the values in the database at the time of update match the original values that User2 has. At 1:05 p.m., User1 changes \"Bob\"'s first name to \"James\" and tries to update the row. Column name Original value Current value Value in database CustID 101 101 101 LastName Smith Smith Smith FirstName Bob James Robert At this point, User1 encounters an optimistic concurrency violation because the value in the database (\"Robert\") no longer matches the original value that User1 was expecting (\"Bob\"). The concurrency violation simply lets you know that the update failed. The decision now needs to be made whether to overwrite the changes supplied by User2 with the changes supplied by User1, or to cancel the changes by User1.","title":"Transaction Overview"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Reference/SQL-Reference/Transactions/transaction-overview/#transactions","text":"MatrixOne supports bundling multiple SQL statements into a single all-or-nothing transaction.

This tester is designed to test MatrixOne or other database functionalities with SQL. What's in MO-Tester? MO-Tester is a java-based tester suite for MatrixOne. It has built a whole toolchain to run automatic SQL tests. It contains the test cases and results. Once launched, MO-Tester runs all SQL test cases with MatrixOne, and compares all output SQL results with expected results. All successful and failed cases will be logged into reports. MO-Tester content locations: Cases : https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tester/tree/main/cases Result : https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tester/tree/main/result Report : once finished running, a mo-tester/report will be generated in the local directory. The Cases and Results are 1-1 correspondence, and they are actually git submodules from MatrixOne repository. Adding new cases and results should be in MatrixOne repo: https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test MO-Tester includes testing cases in the following table. Test cases Description Benchmark/TPCH DDL and 22 Queries of TPCH Benchmark Database DDL Statements, creation/drop databases Table DDL Statements, creation/drop tables DML DML Statements, including insert, select, show statements dtype Data Types and type conversion test cases Expression Case when, With(CTE), Temporal Interval Function Aggregate function, built-in function Explain Explain statement Join Join statement, including Left/Right/Inner/Outer/Natural Join Operator Including +,-,*,/,MOD,%,=, >, <, IS, LIKE etc Subquery Including Select/From/Where subquery Transaction Test of isolation level, atomicity How to use MO-Tester? 1. Prepare the testing environment Make sure you have installed jdk8. Launch MatrixOne or other database instance. Please refer to more information about how to install and launch MatrixOne . Clone mo-tester repository. git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tester.git 2. Configure mo-tester In mo.yml file, configure the server address, default database name, username&password, etc. MO-tester is based on java, so these parameters are required for the JDBC driver. Below is a default example for a local standalone version MatrixOne. #jdbc jdbc: driver: \"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\" server: - addr: \"127.0.0.1:6001\" database: default: \"test\" paremeter: characterSetResults: \"utf8\" continueBatchOnError: \"false\" useServerPrepStmts: \"true\" alwaysSendSetIsolation: \"false\" useLocalSessionState: \"true\" zeroDateTimeBehavior: \"CONVERT_TO_NULL\" failoverReadOnly: \"false\" serverTimezone: \"Asia/Shanghai\" #users user: name: \"dump\" passwrod: \"111\" 3. Run mo-tester With the simple below command, all the SQL test cases will automatically run and generate reports and error messages to report/report.txt and report/error.txt . > ./run.sh If you'd like to adjust the test range, you can just change the path parameter of run.yml . And you can also specify some parameters when executing the command run.sh , parameters are as followings: -p set the path of test cases needed to be executed by mo-tester, the default value is configured by the `path` in `run.yaml` -m set the method that mo-tester will run with, the default value is configured by the `method` in `run.yaml` -t set the type of the format that mo-tester executes the SQL command in, the default value is configured by the `type` in `run.yaml` -r set The success rate that test cases should reach, the default value is configured by the `rate` in `run.yaml` -i set the including list, and only script files in the path whose name contains one of the lists will be executed, if more than one, separated by `,`, if not specified, refers to all cases included -e set the excluding list, and script files in the path whose name contains one of the lists will not be executed, if more than one, separated by `,`, if not specified, refers to none of the cases excluded -g means SQL commands which is marked with [bvt:issue] flag will not be executed,this flag starts with [-- @bvt:issue#{issueNO.}],and ends with [-- @bvt:issue],eg: -- @bvt:issue#3236 select date_add(\"1997-12-31 23:59:59\",INTERVAL \"-10000:1\" HOUR_MINUTE); select date_add(\"1997-12-31 23:59:59\",INTERVAL \"-100 1\" YEAR_MONTH); -- @bvt:issue Those two sql commands are associated with issue#3236, and they will not be executed in bvt test, until the flag is removed when issue#3236 is fixed. -n means the metadata of the resultset will be ignored when comparing the result Examples: bash run.sh -p case -m run -t script -r 100 -i select,subquery -e substring -g If you want to automatically generate SQL results for the new SQL cases, you can just change the method parameter of run.yml to genrs . Running the run.sh scripts will directly record test results in the result/ path with their original filenames. Note: every time running run.sh will overwrite the error , report , and success reports. 4. Check the report Once the test is finished, mo-tester generates error , report and success reports in txt format. An example of report.txt looks like this: [SUMMARY] TOTAL : 486, SUCCESS : 486, ERROR :0, NOEXE :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100% [SUMMARY] TOTAL : 486, SUCCESS : 485, ERROR :1, NOEXE :0, SUCCESS RATE : 99% [cases/transaction/atomicity.sql] TOTAL : 67, SUCCESS : 66, ERROR :1, NOEXE :0, SUCCESS RATE : 98% [cases/transaction/isolation.sql] TOTAL : 202, SUCCESS : 202, ERROR :0, NOEXE :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100% [cases/transaction/isolation_1.sql] TOTAL : 217, SUCCESS : 217, ERROR :0, NOEXE :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100% An example of error.txt looks like this: [ERROR] [SCRIPT FILE]: cases/transaction/atomicity.sql [ROW NUMBER]: 14 [SQL STATEMENT]: select * from test_11 ; [EXPECT RESULT]: c d 1 1 2 2 [ACTUAL RESULT]: c d 1 1","title":"MO-Tester"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Test/mo-tester/#whats-in-mo-tester","text":"MO-Tester is a java-based tester suite for MatrixOne.
