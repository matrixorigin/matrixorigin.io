The MatrixOne documentation is managed in 3 repos: * The main project framework and CI settings are in the matrixorigin.io repo. * The markdown contents are in the docs/en/MatrixOne folder of matrixone repo. * The images and unstructured data are located in the artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io repo contains a submodule which links to matrixone repo contents. The images are referred as webimage links from artwork repo. The matrixorigin.io has implemented a CI project, which will be triggered by a new code merge. This CI workflow publishs the documentation to https://docs.matrixorigin.io/. The documentation project is based on the mkdocs-material . You can find the corresponding syntax and commands with this project. How MatrixOne documentation content is organized? The MatrixOne documentation content is planned with 6 main modules. * Overview: MatrixOne's introduction, features, architecture, tech design etc. * Get Started: How to quickly deploy and run a MatrixOne in a standalone or a distributed environment. * Develop: How to develop some applications based on MatrixOne using different programming language. * Troubleshoot: Introduce common errors and debugging tools. * Reference: SQL reference, Configuration parameters, Error Codes. * FAQs: Product, Technical Design,SQL, Deployment FAQs. How to contribute to documentation project? Fork matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. Clone the matrixorigin.io repo, using --repository to retrieve the submodule of matrixone repo. $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/matrixorigin.io.git As the local repo has the full documentation project code, you can run mkdocs serve under matrixorigin.io folder, and check http://localhost:8000 to check if this project runs well. $ mkdocs serve Make your modification. If the modification is about the project settings, updating sitemap with new pages, or updating the CI workflow code. You can always check http://localhost:8000 to see if your modification is effective. If your modification is about the markdown contents, after you update the docs submodule of matrixorigin.io , the same modifcation should be applied to the matrixone repo. Push your git commits to your Github repos and make PR to matrixorigin.io and matrixone repos. Once your code for both repos is merged, the CI workflow starts running until the documentation website being updated. What we are expecting? Anyone using MatrixOne or interested in MatrixOne is welcome to make contributions for the documentation. You can report confusing concepts, wrong descriptions or better organization format. For the 0.2.0 version, our SQLs and configuration settings are not fully tested, if you find contraints or errors, you are welcome to make your modifiction. The FAQs part is a onging project too, the ones who are more familiar with the project can contribute better answers.","title":"Documentation Contribution Guide"},{"location":"MatrixOne/documentation_contribution_guide/#how-matrixone-documentation-project-is-managed","text":"The MatrixOne documentation is managed in 3 repos: * The main project framework and CI settings are in the matrixorigin.io repo. * The markdown contents are in the docs/en/MatrixOne folder of matrixone repo. * The images and unstructured data are located in the artwork repo.

Key Features Hyperconverged Engine Monolitic Engine A monolithic database engine is designed to support hybrid workloads: transactional, analytical, streaming, time-series, machine learning, etc. Built-in Streaming Engine With the built-in streaming engine, MatrixOne supports in-database streaming processing by groundbreaking incremental materialized view maintenance. Cloud & Edge Native Real Infrastructure Agnostic MatrixOne supports seemless workload migration and bursting among different locations and infrastructures. Multi-site Active/Active MatrixOne provides industry-leading latency control with optimized consistency protocol. Extreme Performance High Performance Accelerated queries supported by patented vectorized execution as well as optimal computation push down strategies through factorization techniques. Strong Consistency MatrixOne introduces a global, high-performance distributed transaction protocol across storage engines. High Scalability Seamless and non-disruptive scaling by disaggregated storage and compute. User Values Simplify Database Management and Maintenance To solve the problem of high and unpredictable cost of database selection process, management & maintenance due to database overabundance, MatrixOne all-in-one architecture will significantly simplify database management and maintenance, single database can serve multiple data applications. Reduce Data Fragmentation and Inconsistency Data flow and copy between different databases makes data sync and consistency increasingly difficult. The unified incrementally materialized view of MatrixOne makes the downstream can support real-time upstream update, achieve the end-to-end data processing without redundant ETL process. Decoupling Data Architecture From Infrastructure Currently the architecture design across different infrastructures is complicated, causes new data silos between cloud and edge, cloud and on-premise.MatrixOne is designed with unified architecture to support simplified data management and operations across different type of infrastructures. Extremely Fast Complex Query Performance Poor business agility as a result of slow complex queries and redundant intermediate tables in current data warehousing solutions. MatrixOne supports blazing fast experience even for star and snowflake schema queries, improving business agility by real-time analytics. An Solid OLTP-like OLAP Experience Current data warehousing solutions have the following problems such as high latency and absense of immediate visibility for data updates. MatrixOne brings OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) level consistency and high availability to CRUD operations in OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). Seamless and Non-disruptive Scaling It is difficult to balance performance and scalability to achieve optimum price-performance ratio in current data warehousing solutions. MatrixOne's disaggregated storage and compute architecture makes it fully automated and efficient scale in/out and up/down without disrupting applications.

Reduce Data Fragmentation and Inconsistency Data flow and copy between different databases makes data sync and consistency increasingly difficult. The unified incrementally materialized view of MatrixOne makes the downstream can support real-time upstream update, achieve the end-to-end data processing without redundant ETL process. Decoupling Data Architecture From Infrastructure Currently the architecture design across different infrastructures is complicated, causes new data silos between cloud and edge, cloud and on-premise.MatrixOne is designed with unified architecture to support simplified data management and operations across different type of infrastructures. Extremely Fast Complex Query Performance Poor business agility as a result of slow complex queries and redundant intermediate tables in current data warehousing solutions.

Vectorized query execution engine, based on MPP solution, is introduced. Part of the expression execution has been vectorized through SIMD instructions. Distributed AOE with strong consistency guaranteed by RAFT has been supported. The performance of replicated state machine has been greatly improved through the unique design of reusing RAFT log as well as Write-Ahead log without any redundancy.

Vectorized query execution engine, based on MPP solution, is introduced. Part of the expression execution has been vectorized through SIMD instructions. Distributed AOE with strong consistency guaranteed by RAFT has been supported. The performance of replicated state machine has been greatly improved through the unique design of reusing RAFT log as well as Write-Ahead log without any redundancy.","title":"Database Engine"},{"location":"MatrixOne/Release-Notes/v0.1.0/#contributors","text":"This release includes 453 commits by 16 authors.

Cheers! Docker docker pull matrixorigin/matrixone:0.2.0 Features Support automatic rebalancing for the built-in AOE columnar storage engine. Introduce new SQL parser. Introduce factorized SQL execution engine which is the fastest MPP in Golang. Support CREATE / DROP INDEX. Support PRIMARY KEY in CREATE TABLE. Support more data types for SQL binary operators. Support equi join with group by or aggregation statements. Support new types of DATE and DATETIME. Database Engine For continuous table creation actions in a script, the parameter of pre-allocated-group-num should be set to a bigger value such in cluster scenarios. Otherwise, \"no available raft group\" may be notified during tables creation sequence. Contributors This release includes 243 commits by 21 authors.
